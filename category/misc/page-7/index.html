<p>It took a lot longer than I thought, but then I got the wheel back in and the disks are on. 160mm front, 190mm rear.</p>
<p>This morning was lots of assembling  and disassembling it all, checking with small spacers the amount of metal to add in. I had forgotten about the axle adapter I had on yesterday  - that was an extra 2mm. All up the wheel dropped down 7mm from the original dropout spot. I ended up getting a 14mm bolt, filing the grove for the 10mm axle, and brazing that in the dropout. Then a 4mm plate on the long part of the dropout slot at the rear to get the whole thing to 10mm.  Lots of filing today.</p>
<p>It works, but its still going to be a bit fiddly to change the wheel. The wheel will not just drop in or out. The axle plate on the Rohloff hits the chain stay tube when at the front of the dropout. With the 14mm dropouts, I didn't notice this as there is more room on both sides for it to all move about. With the dropouts being 10mm, its noticeable. If I put the 4mm on the opposite side (the front of the dropout slot) it would have been better. Putting the wheel in or out, there is some jiggling, and rotating the external gear mech and the OEM axle adaptor, before it all drops in (or out). I'm not about to change it now. I don't need to get the wheel on/off that often, and its not that hard to do.</p>
<p>I did have a moment of wondering if the 203mm disk would be a just bolt on. There is enough room for it. Decided not to try it - as I didn't want to wait more days for a rotor and adapter.  Also had a wonder if there was another size caliper adapter that I could have used instead. Anyway if at some time in the future I want to change it, the bits added in can all be ground out.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The chain - I wanted to have the chain tensioner pushing up, but it didn't work out. The chain hits on the wide loader. Down still works. Don't know how many links on the chain, and I'm not counting them. I'm running 39/16 cogs, with 165mm cranks. Ended up using a half link to get the length just right.</p>
<p>Just as I finished, it started raining - and hasn't stopped. So there was a very short ride in the liquid sunshine.. The brakes feel a bit spongy. Need to ride a bit more to see if that is a real problem, or just my perception of them. Both hoses are too long. The front has way too much hose. Not sure if this affects the brake feeling. Will check this out more when its not raining.</p>
<p>The weather encourages getting mudguards on next. They will not go on easily. Brake calipers are in the way. Can make up short adapters to fix this, but am also thinking about making up some wider guards. I running 1.35 tires on at the moment, at some point I might want to got bigger. I'd like to not have hassles with mud guards then. Going to go hunt about tomorrow and see whats available. Corflute would be handy right now.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I also will put a piece of tube over the chain runs - as I want to try and keep muck off the chain as much as possible. It will also help keep the  bottom run from slapping against the frame. Ideal would be fully enclosed chain running in oil, but that's to hard to do. But any covering has to help with keeping the chain clean. Certainly will help with keeping me clean. I have a piece of 13mm poly tube, but want to try with a larger size. Another thing for tomorrow.</p>
<p>Out of interest, I wondered what the load limit on the Rohloff is. Ended up sending Rohloff an email last night asking. The answer is; there isn't any - but you do have to honor the gearing limits they set. So I can pick up as much stuff as I want - long as I can pedal it. That works for me.</p>

<p>My experience with brand new disc brakes is that it takes time for all of the little imperfections on the pads to wear off, and all the little imperfections in the rotor to be impressed upon the pads. Once this has happened the effective surface area of the rotor is increased and the braking power improves a lot.  The same is true for drum brakes (although the break-in is shorter).</p>

<p>Good stuff.  Keep us posted.  I echo keller74's comments that your disc tab is different than my V3- with my holes essentially parallel to the chainstay.  Also I noticed threaded bosses on the downtube near the head on Jim's orange V3 that are not my V3.  For the bread rack I guess?  John</p>

<p>The new rotor arrived today. Its actually the 190mm Magura option from Rohloff. As I guessed, it is a bit big for the caliper to bolt onto. Yuba recommending a 180mm for the rear. I think a 185 would be just spot on.</p>
<p>When I ordered the frame, I also I ordered the adapter from Yuba for the rear 180mm disk. Looking at it now, its way too small. The brakes arrived with two different size adapters - 1 small  (that almost matches the Yuba one),  and one larger - that works better on the rear. Better, but not perfect.</p>
<p>The image above has the caliper resting down onto the top of the rotor. This is with the axle adapters on the Rohloff hub, in the 14mm dropouts. At both ends its about 5mm to bolt flat to the adapter. (Its easier to see the gap on the front bolt.) This will sort its self out tomorrow when the dropouts get narrowed. I'll get some more metal at the bottom of each dropout - and the rotor will drop downward. I might also put some spacers between the adapter, and the caliper to fine tune the height - to get it just right.</p>
<p>I'm excited now - this is all stuff that can be done by me - so there is not more waiting for parts to arrive. Baring any unexpected developments, I should be able to have a ride tomorrow.</p>

<p>You are close!  I had a similar experience with Hayes hydraulics on a Kona Mtb- acutally found some thick aluminum washers to shim the calipers up so my pads were contacting the disc perfectly.  As you say, your dropouts rework gives you latitude to adjust this.  J.</p>

<p>Yes it looks like your close to getting rear disc brakes on a Yuba (one of a very small elite group in the world I think!). Loving the blog (more pics please!) and great to see another Mundo builder in Australia. You seem to have the new style of rear disc mount (on my V3 the 2 holes are parallel to the frame) which is no doubt making the process easier.</p>

<p>Finally the trip to the postoffice, saw me return with a large box. First thing was to fit the rear - as it was probably the one that was going to be the problem. Arrrg...It still is a problem :( The 160mm Rohloff rotor is too small (Well that or the disk mount is too high.) I had suspected that before, but was assured that it would all be fine.</p>
<p>Changing the adapter when I realised that I had two different sized ones, helped slightly, but not enough. Still too little disk rotor is under the pads. And still too much for me to "fix" by changes to the dropouts. Not happy. I could have ordered a larger rotor earlier, and not be sitting now waiting again.</p>

<p><em>sighs</em> more waiting time. Need to order a larger rotor. Rohloff don't do a 180mm or 185mm any more, so its either 190mm or 203mm. Yuba recommended a 180mm Rotor, so I'm going to go with the 190mm.</p>
<p>So, more daily trips to the post office waiting for a larger rotor.</p>
<p>The front fits without any dramas. So I've one brake. Might fit up the chain and have bit of a ride about on the weekend.</p>

                <p>The new axle plate makes mounting the wheel a lot easier.  Will wait until I sort out the disk before making the dropouts 10mm. When I narrow the dropouts, I'll add a bit more metal for the torque plate to press against.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Not sure if the 160mm rotor will work. The amount of rotor that is available at the disk mount looks a bit short.</p>
<p>Could get a few millimeters more by making the dropout deeper, but not to much more, else the axle nuts will hit the tube.</p>
<p>I'm not the first to have hassles with the rear disk mount.  I'm hoping that it will not take me too long to sort out.</p>

<p>I'd love to have an internal gear hub on my Mundo, but the ones in my price range aren't rated for any serious loads.  its a shame because I love the gear hubs on my other bikes, even if they are just 3 speeds.  Did you consider the Nuvinci CVP hub before deciding on the Rohloff?  I think I may one day put one of those on mine, partly because they are cheaper and partly because the idea of continuously variable transmission intrigues me (plus it has been done before on the Long Walk To Green blog and held up to heavy loads well).</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck with your build, and once you take it out for a spin I think you will enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>Didn't think about any other hub. I had the Rohloff already. I've used Rohloff hubs in load bikes before. Friends have also. Never had a problem. Some of the bikes had way more load, and way stronger riders powering them, than I am. So the hub is built to last.</p>

<p>Hi Megan.  Good blog.  Makes me want to ride more......</p>
<p>I too have a V3- its awesome- Likely a good choice for being tough when you aren't consumed with weight.</p>
<p>Mine is pretty bare bones, however, external gears and vee brakes.  I have custom fitted aluminium checkplate to the rear rack and sideloaders, added Sweetskinz tires, Electra chrome plated fenders, and a Rolling  Jackass centrestand.  Maybe discs later this year.....</p>
<p>Once I get a front rack on my V3 I will post some pics somewhere. Will be following your Rohloff build. Cheers from Canada's west coast. John</p>
