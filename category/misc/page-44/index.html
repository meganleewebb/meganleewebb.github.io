                <p>Nothing to exciting heading down the road to Mitchell. Lots of traffic, compared to what I have had. At Mitchell, I have a weekend to spend before getting to Roma. So I take the scenic route. Dirt roads with no traffic. Much better.</p>
<p>I stopped Saturday afternoon just sort of the tar again. Went back up the road 5km to find a sheltered spot. Showers were forecast. Could happen,  might not.</p>
<p>Turned out it poured. All Sunday. My spot was sheltered, but the amount of water coming down, and the dry soil. Had mud running under the tent. Water also dripped in in a few places also. I don't think the Hubba Hubb Tent is a wet weather tent. More like a fine weather, with chance of rain tent. Used spare plastic I had to keep the sleeping gear off the floor.</p>
<p>Mondays ride into Roma was also very wet. Mud everywhere. Glad I went back up the road, the spots close to the tar were underwater.</p>
<p>I did spend Sunday cleaning up my bags. Found the usual amount of non essential stuff. Was happy to be able to reduce my load by a kilo. But since then picked up more stuff from the road supermarket. Currently carrying a whole roll of pink marking tape, and a full packed of giant cable ties. Both look useful, but I don't think I need them.</p>

                <p>Washed everything. The new poison smells good - no smell or taste. Still watching the ticks die as they try and climb up the tent or my leg.</p>
<p>The caravan park was $24 a night for two person site, but since i was on my own it was reduced to $20. Hmmm not much of a reduction.</p>
<p>Ate lots and then headed out to Morven. Stopped and took a picture of the Kero Hut. Made from old tins, during the depression years. Lots of families lived in these type huts. Wouldn't happen today..</p>

                <p>Headed out the old Charleville Road to Charleville of course. Not a road that is well advertised. Not a road that is maintained either. You start by going through some closed gates. Then you need to keep you sense of direction turned on. It appears to take a bend and cross a creek, but a bit later, alarms should be ringing, it turns further west. Time to go back. The bend before the river, has a small track that continues straight ahead. You want that. Follow for the next 30km, avoiding cows.</p>

</a></p>
<p>And finally join the Mitchell Highway, 20km outside of Augathella. Sure the highway would have been quicker, but no where near as scenic or as much fun.</p>
<p>I decided to stay the night in Charleville. The sheep dip taste in my water and food was getting to me. I was going to ignore it some more, but then talking with a guy outside the IGA, he mentioned there was a strong sheep dip smell, and that I was the cause of it. Soon as he said 'sheep dip' I knew it was me. Bought some more soap, and went to find a caravan park to wash in.  Really annoying actually, as the poison is odourless and tasteless. Its just the "flavour" that gives it the awful smell and taste. Why can't they make it strawberry or banana? So the agenda for the day was wash everything - tent, bedding, clothing, ground sheets, water bags, bags, bottles, etc.. Yep, everything. The stuff didn't have any smell on my clothes when dry, but when wet, the sheep dip smell was back.  Finally got everything smelling , well, not of sheep dip. A definite improvement.</p>
<p>Then hunted up food, and more poison for the ticks. This time, I did the smell test before buying.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I'm almost giddy with excitement. I've bought poison! The ticks have had their day. I'm tired of being food. We've had an uneasy relationship. They scurry up my legs as fast as they can. I try to spot them and flick them off. No matter how many I spot, I always had the feeling some were avoiding my gaze.  I got good at pinching the spots I couldn't see and picking them off. But the were always more. Finally, enough!</p>
<p>I stopped early, and sprayed my tent, ground sheets, straps, ocky cords, shoes, socks, only the below the knees of my pants. I smell like a dipped sheep. But no more ticks! It was with great satisfaction I found dead ones in the tent this morning. As they keep climbing out of my gear, they will all die.  The only down side of this - besides smelling of a dipped sheep - is that at times my water seems to taste the same. Small price to pay I decide. I sleep well at night now.</p>
<p>Continuing south, I pass the Dog Fence. Though, I'm sure I saw dogs on either side of it. Not sure how useful it is really.</p>

                <p>Riding along a quiet back road, I find an old bridge. I have to dismount and walk across it, but it talks to me as I pass.</p>
<p>Much more friendly than the newer bridges that stay silent...</p>
