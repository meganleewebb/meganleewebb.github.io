                <p>I woke to the steady sound of rain on the tent. Then patched a rare puncture: steel wire just punctured the rear tube.  Loaded up and cycled off. My clothes haven't been drying and my skin is softening.  After I warm up, I ride without my rain jacket, hoping the water will wash me off. All that happens is that I feel cold and wet. Days like today, I find no takers for my life outdoors.</p>
<p>I'd wondered if I could have gone to Bylong without extra food. But today I know the answer; I would have suffered badly if I did. I'm tired, hungry and not feeling very energetic. I call a short day and stop at Burning Mountain.</p>
<p>Lucky for me, I have the whole rest area too myself.</p>

                <p>The best made plans, soon go out the window. I rode the back way into Denman from Jerrys Plains. Longer, and less traffic than the more direct route. Unfortunately for me the yearly festival was on, and the IGA was closed for the day. I was planning to go to Bylong to escape the rain, but needed food. The caravan park in Denman was $25 a night. Way to much in my opinion. So I turned towards Muswellbrook and then north towards Scone.</p>
<p>After 80km, I called it a day, and cooked up the last of my food for dinner. Another day and night of rain. Tomorrow, shopping in Scone.</p>

                <p>Awaking and packing up, I've legs of steel. Though, it's not strength that I'm thinking of. They' feel heavy, unbending and dense.</p>
<p>I have a free breakfast, when some volunteers wave me into their "breakfast for shift workers" stand. They run the stand to help the miners get home. After a 12 hour shift, some are driving a couple hours to the coast. Sometimes they don't make it. But if they stop, they might wake up a bit.</p>
<p>More land around Bulga is being prepared for mining. Scrapped back to bare earth. Then the digging will start. The bush I'd seen in previous years is all gone.</p>
<p>Sadly I ride on into the rain.</p>

                <p>Wasn't much better today. I'm tired, and the showers continue. Least there isn't much wind. The road I was on was narrow, with a lot of truck traffic. Not ideal.I wanted to stop at Wollembi, but the camp ground is too close to the creek, and still had water pooled on it. With more rain forecast, it was on to Broke.</p>

                <p>It took another attempt to leave. But finally I made it out. The first attempt, the trains were not running well, and I had a "did I turn off the stove" moment. Rather than spend days wondering I went back.</p>
<p>Finally I was off. Standing in the rain, cold, I was hoping for better weather. It did ease up later in the day. but I struggled with lack of fitness. After 40 km, I called it a day and set up camp.</p>
