                <p>As part of the clean up of gear, I sold my stove.  The MSR Whisperlite International is a fine stove, but it was heavier than I wanted to be carrying.  My only practical alternative was an alcohol stove.  Gas I ruled out as its only possible to get the canisters in the cities. Wood fires attract too much attention.</p>

<p>I used this Evernew Titanium stove with pot stand for a while, but eventually I had enough of it.  The pot stand was a bit too small for my pot, and the pot slide on it easily, meaning you held the pot a lot or risked it falling off.  When the stove was warmed up, the flames would bulge downwards and almost scorch the ground around it. It needing a flame proof base.  Even with the fuel measurements stamps on the inside, it was hard to measure a small amount into it. There is fibreglass wool between the two walls, and this soaks up the fuel. Pour a small amount in, and it all vanished into the wool - how much is there? So you add more, till there is fuel visible in the bottom. The stove has to burn out - it isn't possible to blow or snuff it out. And it always kept the smell of fuel in it.  It did cook my lunch fast though.</p>
<p>My new stove would solve all these problems, make my lunch and clean up too.  I started making stoves

<a href="http://zenstoves.net/">Zen stoves</a>
has a wealth of stove types and build information,  but google found other interesting stove designs.</p>

</a></p>
<p>After a several builds of stoves like the
<a href="http://andrewskurka.com/2011/how-to-make-a-fancy-feast-alcohol-stove/">fancy feast</a>
(see
<a href="http://andrewskurka.com/2015/super-cat-fancy-feast-backpacking-alcohol-stove-flaws/">flaws of this stove</a>
), and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove">some other variations</a>
I decided I wanted something simpler.  Stoves that needed certain sized holes punched or drilled, precision cuts, carefull press fits or gluing ended up being too fiddly. When assembled correctly, they worked well, but I wanted simple and quick to make.  I also tried home build models with fibreglass wool wicks, stainless steel mesh tops like the
<a href="http://www.woodgaz-stove.com/starlyte-stove.php">starlyte stoves</a>
.  These decided that I didn't like not being able to see how much fuel was in the pot, nor the left over smell of fuel after using.  This might have been better if I had found a lid I could seal the stove with like the Starlyte offers.  Lots of hunting about shops for metal tins with fitted lids. Note: the website doesn't ship internationally.</p>
<p>In the testing,
<a href="http://zenstoves.net/TeaLight.htm">tea candle stoves</a>
seemed promising, but never held enough fuel to fully boil 2 cups (500ml) of water. It got close, but just not enough. Eventually I hit on the red bull can stove.  Find a red bull can. Cut the bottom off 25mm (1 inch) from the bottom. Done. Stove finished.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2017/IMG_20170120_183006372.jpg" >
<img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2017/IMG_20170120_183006372.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The stove would hold enough fuel to boil 2 cups water for a few minutes. Was easy to make, easy to fill. Able to see how much fuel was left. Didn't need to be filled to the brim. Is very light. Lighter than the titanium stove!  If a red bull can can't be found, a coke can will do, but I found the red bull was easier to gauge the fuel amount when filling.  After it burns out, it cools quickly, so can be refilled for a second burn if needed.  (Two burns are needed for dry baking.)</p>
<p>Simmering is accomplished by a piece of aluminium foil bent over the top. Adjust as needed for the flame size.  This can also be used to snuff the flame out.</p>
<p>A coat hanger bent into shape is my pot stand. Easy to make, robust and non slip.</p>
<p>By the time I arrived at this point in my stove testing, I was over stove testing.  So even though it didn't cook lunch nor clean up, I stopped experiments.</p>
<p>For the record, I did try using tea candles to dry bake with, but didn't succeed. I suspect it was because I was using (claimed) 9 hour tea candles. The heat was never enough for the number of candles I could get under the pot.  All that happened was the pot was blackened with a waxy residue  and after about an hour I would end the test with raw dough.  Two burns of the red bull stove with the simmer cover is enough to bake one bread bun.</p>
<p>Other items that went in the gear clean up was my kitchen knife; 160 grams was too much knife. 500 grams of Useful string. You never know when you need to tie something up, or lots of somethings. But I decided I didn't need to carry quite that much weight in string.  Tent pegs were culled from 30 down to a more sensible number, though probably still to many. Battery packs from three to one. Stuff sacks had previously been breeding like rabbits - down to just a couple. Clothing - less of it, no more spares of spares.  Dropped the two snake bandages that I've carried since I started travelling.</p>

                <p>More time has passed than I had thought.  After the last post, 2016 can be summed up as 'lots of injuries and illnesses.'</p>
<p>I flew back to Sydney, with bits of my cart and stayed at a friends. Spent a lot of time waiting in doctors surgeries, taking tables, applying creams and ointments and hoping for a cure. I had a couple of skin infections from the tropics, but had three cases of bites (tick, leech, spider?)  that became swollen and infected also.  Besides losing some finger and toe nails, all turned out okay in the end.</p>
<p>I wasn't happy with the three wheeled pram, so had a period of building carts:</p>

</a></p>
<p>Another one wheeler.</p>
<p>There were many more. Some didn't get finished before it became clear the design would not work.  Most where one and two wheels.  A solitary four wheel idea never made it off paper.</p>
<p>Also was footwear experiments. Two of the wearable attempts:</p>

<p>The footwear kept me busy the longest.  Walking started out simple, but then became more complicated. What could be so hard - put shoes on and walk. Most of us have this sorted by year one.  For me, years of bicycle riding (without stretching), with a lot of pushing a heavy bicycle on cambered road edges, in sandals that were too narrow for my feet had left me with more than a few problems.</p>
<p>Besides pain from my toes pressing together, my feet faced different directions - great for pushing loaded bike uphill, not so great for long distance walking.</p>
<p>I bought a pair of Vibram Five Fingers.  Loved them at first. Then they fell out of favour because they don't dry out as well as sandals. Gradually, they returned, though I change to sandals in the rain or on wet paths.  Back to being very fond of them.  Love the way your toes can spread out. I credit them for solving the toe press problems.  Standing barefeet, all my toes have a gap between them. Some smaller than others, but coming from needing to put foam spacers between some toes to sleep at night, this is a huge improvement.</p>
<p>I walk barefoot more and more. I'd like to be barefoot full time, but roadside edges are not friendly places for bare feet: glass, thorns and metal fragments. I'm not willing to risk lack of mobility from injury.  Stepping on a rusty tin can, hidden in the grass is not a bare foot feeling I want to experience.</p>
<p>The home made footwear making started as a search for an alternative to the Vibrams, that allowed my toes to spread out more. I found it hard to find sandals that don't cramp the toes.  Making your own footwear is interesting. There is more involved in it than it appears. The experimenting  continues - my current sandal is a combination of a commercial sandal that I cut apart with a different sole I glued on.</p>

<p>Went for a walk for a couple of days. Averaged 17km per day, which doesn't sound like much. I'm suffering big time in the heat and humidity. Middle of winter and it's hitting 28c with feels like of 30. Overnight lows of low 20s. Doesn't feel like winter at all.</p>
<p>Been doing 6km walks with hiking poles. That was all okay. Starting from the family home first thing in the morning. Got a cart to carry my gear, but the it had a faulty wheel. Only just received the replacement.</p>
<p>Feet a little sore, but it's to be expected. Was worried about blisters at the end of day one, but they settled overnight. I put tape over the likely spots the next day. Not sure I can carry enough tape though.</p>

<p>My first loaf that I'm having for brunch. Four tea candles for 45 minutes. The bread is soft, but I'll experiment more now that I'm on the road and try for a crust.</p>

                <p>I did leave Sydney with the K-Mart bike to head north.  The bike worked well. The front forks stayed rigid and showed no signs of movement. Gearing was higher than I'd like - so did a fair bit of walking. With all the walking, I started having foot problems. My feet were still not up to walking much. With most of the trip still to go, I decided to return to Sydney to recover.</p>
<p>The body healed with rest, but then there was a family incident, so I flew to Cairns with just a the essentials in a backpack - electronics, sleeping bag, clothes, cooking gear, tarp, bug net and miscellaneous items. I like to be independent. The original plan was to either fly back to Sydney or walk with the backpack. However, the walk from the airport had me thinking that some wheels might be better. So after much searching about, I found some.</p>

<p>It sounds really alluring to just drop everything and go explore the world for the rest of your life. However, now isn’t the right time for me but in the future the option might just re-open for me as the thought is still present. Sydney is indeed a nice place to hit with so many attractions and sceneries to enjoy and countless other cities within Australia as well.</p>
