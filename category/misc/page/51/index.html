<p>I use two straps around my panniers to hold them in place.  The metal buckle is easy and quick to use, but weighs 56 grams.  Cut it off and use two cable ties like D-rings.</p>
<p>Also cut off the extra strap that is not needed. Too long is just a hassle to keep out of the wheels.</p>
<p>EDIT: This doesn't work as well as I'd thought on the bike. IF you set it up and load the ends, it holds well, but pull the end to tighten the load and the cable ties roll, and then slip.</p>
<p>3-May-2011: EDIT: On the road, still trying to use this method, I found that if I tighten the cable ties enough, so the strap has to fold to pass through it, then it works really well.</p>

<p>The ocky straps have evil metal hooks on them. Evil because the little black rubber boots on the end of the wire soon comes off, then the wire hook punctures tents, panniers, and skin easily.</p>
<p>Buy shock cord from Bunnings and cheap clips from a $2 shop. Tie two knots to keep the cord from working lose. Shock cord is more elastic than the ocky straps, and you can make the cord exactly the length you need.</p>

<p>Removing the handles saves 40gm. I use the shifter (adjustable spanner) on the body, and a 5mm allen key in on the screw drive. Also packs in my tool kit easier.</p>

<p>How much does the shifter weigh?</p>

<p>Don't have a scale handy to weigh it. The previous one was 200gm. The new one, about 150gm I'm guessing.  I'm already carrying the shifter for other uses.</p>

                <p>Changing your bike again!!!</p>
<p>Yeah, been a few changes over the past year. Each time I thought it was the "right" decision. What can I say - I make some bad decisions.  But am learning :)</p>
<p>The Yuba definitely rides smoothly. Nice bike for cruising along. Also works well for carrying what ever you want. No worries about the strengh of the frame. Going to miss the solid no flex rack.</p>
<p>Am currently back on my old Aluminium MTB frame. The Yuba is on ebay and has offers so it will sell. Why the change? Number of reasons.</p>
<p>The extra length touring causes me problems. About town I can't get into some lifts, going through bicycle path squeeze points - it doesn't make it. I have to lift the back wheel up and move it to make it around. This also happens on the wheel chair ramps. The weight of my gear and the bike and the length don't make it easy for me to do this. Not I'm not in town that much, but the lifting and moving it affects me even in the bush.</p>
<p>Can't lift it over a fence easily. Noticed this more on the Lithgow trip with a friend on a standard length bike. Two of us managed, but I wouldn't do it on my own. (Actually, I can't lift the Yuba easily even when unloaded.)</p>
<p>I've no hope of getting it on a plane because of the extra weight and the length.</p>
<p>Yeah, the extra weight - noticing it more that I'm in Sydney. Places I've cycled lots. I expect to travel a certain speed and with the Yuba that isn't possible. Interestingly this didn't bother me in the country. So think its just I'm "back in the old places".</p>
<p>So after anguishing over it for a few weeks, its back to the MTB frame.</p>

<p>No not me!</p>
<p>While wandering about Sydney, I stopped to listen to Alex and Mish playing and singing outside of Broadway Shopping Center. Great music.</p>

                <p>Well arrived in Sydney on the Monday, and then left to go camping up near Lithgow with Claire. We rode a track towards Newnes. Twas a nice track. Had to unpack the bikes and carry the gear and bikes past a few obstructions. Lucky for two of us - the Yuba is a bit heavy for me to lift on my own over some things - like fence gates. Also with two, we were able to lift the bikes over other obstructions without unpacking them.  For a four day trip, I had a lot of failures in the footwear departmeent - my Shimano sandals and thongs broke. Both held together by cable ties quite successfully.</p>
<p>Now in Sydney - have started replacing or upgrading gear. Thermarest is in for a warrenty claim - its got a large bubble in the middle of it. Might go a lighter version or foam when or if it returns.  Need to patch holes in the tent. Replaced the crank puller with the way lighter Shimano version. 5mm thick steel  knife sharpener is being replaced with a 50gm version. Folding knife that doesn't lock shut is being replaced with one with a better lock so it stays shut when it should.</p>
<p>Aslo culling over weight items. 0.5kg of paper converted to pdf.  0.5kg bag of string chopped to just one piece for the clothes line. Clothes that are too worn but still carried are discard and replaced.  "spare" clothes that never been used  have been given away. Spare fuel bottle is gone. Keeping the 650ml bottle only.  Blue Ortlieb bags are gone - cut down enouth bulk to shove everything into the panniers.</p>
<p>Had 26kg when left Brisbane - thats before food and water and includes pannier weight. Will see what it all weighs when I leave Sydney next. Will be about for  couple of weeks.</p>
