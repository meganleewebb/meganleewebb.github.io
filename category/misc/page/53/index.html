                <p>Christmass day:birds singing, water rushing. Memories of childhood christmass days. Food, rest. Watched the couple near by move their baby about all day - to get it into the shade, closer to where they had moved their chairs. Designer baby. Straight from Toyota land.</p>
<p>There was a sudden heavy down pour, but then it fined up again.</p>
<p>Set off early on Boxing day with overcaste weather. Planned to stop in Ulan. Hit a new Top Speed: 81.86km/hr. Down hill obviously.</p>
<p>Ulan has lots of mines. Air smelt of sulphur.  Was raining heavy when I got near there. Decided to keep going.</p>
<p>More driver silliness: Saw a car pulled over - but disappointingly saw that they stopped to add more rum to their drink.  A 4wd packed with young males, speeding along a rough dirt road. Bouncing, slipping or skidding, airborne, stones and water flying out the sides.</p>
<p>Even with all my gear on the back, the back wheel can lose traction on wet clay. Most unsettling.</p>
<p>125km for the day. 8hours pedalling time.</p>

<p>Tambarr Springs has amazing views out across the  landscape. But I didn't see any unusual creatures...</p>
<p>Found a small cemetry tucked away in the bushes on the edge of the road between Tambar Springs and Coolah. I wonder how many people notice it. Most of the stones are unreadable, but saw 1800's mentioned more than once.. A few more years and nothing will be left.. The last deposit was in 1993.</p>
<p>The Black Stump! I've passed it. I'm beyond the black stump. The pic is from on side. Not sure if before or after it. It looks like a burn't branch to me actually. A plaque states there was a black stump once, but was burned down in a fire. A long with the hotel that was near by..   The black stump isn't what it once was... The silly season is in full swing, and its now a rest stop.</p>
<p>Decided to stop in Coolah, as the roads are crazy busy. And for a small back road, just too many idiot about..</p>
<p>There will be moans about the road toll over Xmass/New Year. The thing I find surprising is that there are not more crashes. Slowing up is a fate worse than death..</p>

<p>Pictures: Wean race course. Its overgrown with grass at the moment.</p>
<p>Some of the rock pools at Dripping Rock.</p>
<p>Didn't leave Barraba until 11:30. A very late start for me. Lucky 10km down the road was a shed. Rested there and had lunch till the sun cooled off a bit.  Lots of dirt roads, flies, mossies and cows. Very quiet on the road though.  Sorted out the flies. I've some strings hanging off my helment, that swing in front of my face. Keeps the flies out of my eyes and nose.  Took a detour to see "Dripping Rock". Yep, its a waterfall, that was flowing. Been a lot of rain lately here. My plans to have a swim were dashed but the number of mossies. Some are basically flying syringes. Standing still - you could almost feel your blood pressure dropping. No chance I going to give them more skin to feast on.  Had a flat tire this morning. It went down yesterday, but after pumping it up, I kept riding for another 40km to find a spot to camp. With all the rain here, there is a lot of water lying around on the road side. Got wet feet several times going over causeways.  Flat repair was easy, once I moved into the tent to do it. To many mossies outside. The hole looks like a thorn - but couldn't find anything stuck in the tire. Time will tell if I missed it. </p>

<p>I'm back in Barraba. But only for a short time. I was good resting here for a couple of days, but the weather is cool and sunny and I've itchy feet. Want to keep moving..</p>
<p>The road here from Inverell was interesting. Met several wonderful people.  I'll have more on that in the new year. Emails are being exchanged, plans are being formed.</p>
<p>Stopped at Copeland Dam briefly. The water level was down to 6%, its now at 40%. Long way till the spill ways are in use again.  The road travels along the top of the dam wall. You can see the two different height trees - the old growth, and the new trees growing on land that should be under water when the dam is full.</p>
<p>Some of the road was dirt - hilly and steep, meandering amongst the cows. I crossed several causeways, flowing with water high enought to get wet feet.</p>
<p>With all the rain, there are lots of flies, and mossies. The flies are the ones that try and go up your nose, and into your eyes. Don't open your mouth!!</p>
<p>The land is very green and lush. On one steep hill, I got to see two Dung Bettles rolling a ball of dung along. They were much smaller than I expected, but very entertaining. I just wish it wasn't on such a steep hill.</p>

                <p>Had enough resting in Texas. The weather had returned to showers, so time to move on. Left Sunday morning in the rain. Later in the day the sun came out and it was hot. Tar melting hot. Tar was running like honey in some spots.  Rested in Ashford for a while- most of the mid day actually. Then stopped about 20km outside of Inveral for another few hours.. Slept beside a hay field. Oh did that smell nice.</p>
<p>More showers on the way..</p>
