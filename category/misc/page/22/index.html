<p>Just on dawn a small shower drifts in. Just enough to dampen the ground, and the tent. But oh, the smells it brings out. The air is alive with smells; soil, dust, hay, wet blanket (paddock of sheep nearby), and others unidentifiable. Want to keep inhaling, to not miss out.</p>
<p>30km to Dunedoo, 10km to Mendooran. I go to Mendooran. The oldest town for something. But it's a dying town. Cafe closed and for sale, shop for sale, houses for sale. You guess that no one is buying. The helpful NRMA man doesn't know about the road my GPS is suggesting to Wellington. The area is a swamp, could be a fire trail there he says. He suggests an alternative that he knows exists. Off I go, but, another change of plan. Down a dirt road, and then into Dunedoo after all.</p>
<p>Dunedoo surprises me with Neptune. I thought I was done with the solar system.</p>

                <p>It's the end of school holidays. Parents with kids abound. But the parents aren't really present. Kids on the play equipment, parents, attention glued to their phone. It looks wrong. What message does that give the child? This phone is more interesting than you?</p>
<p>Heading out of town, I unexpectedly encounter Saturn. I'd missed most of the solar system! It's childishly amusing to see that I'm heading towards Uranus. I won't see it though, as I'll be off on a dirt road before then. Uranus, the  seventh largest planet, the only one named from Greek mythology, rather than Roman. It's only been visited once in 1986 by Voyager 2, as it flew past on the way to Neptune.</p>
<p>Eating breakfast in Binnaway, I watch a magpie swooping the kids. It doesn't go for me. Maybe it spies the tanned, dried feet hanging off my bike, and suspects it could end up like that if it comes too close. Maybe it likes kids as they are smaller. Later it does take a few swoops at me, bouncing off my head. So much for that theory.</p>
<p>I ignore the angry young man, who threatens to run me over. Though, I do wait until he has driven off north, then I continue heading south. My dirt road waits for me. Later I chat with a couple of farmers. Amongst other things, they tell me the turn onto a road I was planning to take doesn't exist any more. I'd been a bit iffy about that bit too, suspecting the GPS might not have the right info. But that's ok. It had been an enjoyable ride so far. With all the talk, the sun is sinking. After we part, I camp a few kilometers further on in some trees.</p>

                <p>Pleasant days. Baradine is a lovely little town. The temps are good. Scenery easy on the eyes.I linger in the bush, reluctant to leave. Twice I'm back in town to get more water, my camp is on a ridge and the creek below is dry. I read and make a net from builders twine. I watch the birds, ants, beetles and occasional roo as the sun swings its arc overhead. Must I leave?</p>
<p>When the water runs out again, I ride into Coonabarbran.</p>
<p>A Woolworths! So much food. The man setting up the garden section sees me and says where to lean my bike, and that he'll watch it. So helpful and friendly. I buy way to much, not having had breakfast yet..Never shop when hungry! A lesson I know, but ignore.</p>
<p>I find the clocks have changed. "Daylight savings" has started/ended. The day light looks the same to me.. I wonder what happens with the savings.</p>
<p>Now sitting in the park; eating.</p>

                <p>Time for a wash. Pilliga has a public hot spring. Actually it's a bore that empties into a pool.</p>
<p>When I arrived, the park was busy. Lots of caravans, motor homes and campervans. Well a lot compared to how many I'd seen recently. I rode up, took my sandals off and walked into the pool. Figured my clothes needed a bit of a clean also. The water comes out of the bore warm, and with a salt content. I was hoping it was less than what was on my clothing. Only stayed in a bit, then out to dry off.</p>
<p>Temps have been trending upwards, so it didn't take long to dry. I interacted with a few of the visitors. Apart from one couple, parked noticeably away from everyone else, people were not happy. Grumpy would describe them. Not sure why.</p>
<p>I was happy. Fine day, a wash, food, water. I didn't stay. While there was a lot of room, a spot on the first was already reserved for me. Off down the dirt road towards Baradine I went.</p>

<p>I found breakfast on the road this morning. Courtesy of the semi-trailer that went past earlier. The bird was definitely fresh road kill. Didn't get much off it; two bits the size of oysters. I'd have thought it would have been tender, having been hit by a truck, and being a young bird. Maybe it was my cooking technique. It was a tough chew...</p>
<p>It didn't add a lot in calories either. Need to find bigger road kill.</p>
<p>Burren Junction is a dead town. The shop closed last Friday. The servo had shut. Only the pub is left. I only stopped at the rest area out of town to cook breakfast, then headed towards Pilliga.</p>
