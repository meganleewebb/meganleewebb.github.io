                <p>It seemed a good idea at the time... A non trafficked route to Jenolan Caves. Quiet. Scenic. The map showed bicycles allowed on it been Megalong Valley Road and Jenolan Caves Road. I could then continue touring southwards.</p>
<p>It's downhill from Blackheath to the track start. There I chatted with some walkers, returning from the Cox River. They were tired, having abandoned their walk to Jenolan and turned back.</p>
<p>In high hopes, I rode off. The first kilometre was on a road, then the track started. This was the last I rode for the next three days.</p>
<p>I expected some walking would be involved. Crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge involves stairs... The track was rough, narrow, rocky with stairs, fences and gates. Considerable effort was required. After a while I continued on in the hope it would improve. It didn't.</p>
<p>Portage over the rougher spots, stairs and fences involved up to six trips. The river crossing also was exciting. Do you carry over the important stuff first? Or gain practice first? Is anything not important?</p>
<p>I'd optimistically planned on making the second camp site, but was sufficiently exhausted to stay at the Coxs. The camp that night was quiet. I was the only one, after the last of the 4x4's left.</p>
<p>The road resumed from the camp site. It goes up, and up, and up. After four hours pushing up hill, I pulled the pin and walked back to the Coxs. I'd managed just over 1km/hr. It was hot, and I wouldn't have had enough water to get out. And at that point I was still less than half way.</p>
<p>No 4x4s when you want one..</p>
<p>The only alternative was back the way I'd come. 6.5km of it. While it was three hours down, going back would take longer as it would be uphill. It only took me 5 hours.</p>
<p>The ride/walk back up Megalong Valley Road seemed easy after that.</p>
<p>I'd say the Six Foot Track is a mountain biking track, rather than loaded tourer riding track. Though it would be easier starting from the Jenolan end; more hills from that side.</p>

                <p>Well, for a short time anyway. I've still been hanging out in Sydney. A few things are dragging on.  "End of the week". "First thing next week".  After a few times of this, all creditability has gone.</p>
<p>So, heading out for a few weeks ride and then will return and hopefully be done.</p>
<p>Was up at 3:30am - couldn't sleep. Wasn't leaving for another 4 hours, and most was packed. Packing up the tent, the only worry I had was "where did that spider go..."</p>
<p>Everything fits back in the panniers - so well, that I wonder if I've forgotten anything. So I grabbed a few extras just in case. Now it looks suitably full. Probably end up ditching the stuff later..</p>
<p>Due to quirks of Cityrail, travelling today (Sunday) has less train changes, larger cross over times at the changes and is an hour faster than travelling tomorrow. Cause, that all depended on the trains running "on time". Since
<u>
C
</u>
ityRail defines "ontime" as "within 10 minutes of the time table" it means that making connections is iffy.</p>

                <p>The van is gone, the gear is packed, but I remain.  A couple of tasks require my presence in Sydney, so I'm not able to leave just yet.</p>

<p>My fitness declined in the past year. I was reminded of this last week, when I rode from the city to Hornsby. I set out just before lunch, a couple hours, I'll eat when I get there. The first half was easy, then I started feeling tired. It was hot - the heatwave. The sensible thing would have been to stop, rest, have lunch, but I was focusing on arriving first. I pushed on, into the hills. Soon I hit the wall, and a little later while I was down, the wall fell on me. I was shattered. Even walking was an effort. I was so glad when I could lie down.  I slept well that night.</p>
<p>Getting about everywhere by bike, its slowly coming back. All that incidental travel adds up. I'm helping it along by taking daily rides, gradually increasing the distances.</p>

                <p>Wow. It's all coming together quicker than I thought.</p>
<p>Funds are coming together; the last EBay auctions finish on Sunday. Hopefully the van sale will be concluded this weekend too.</p>
<p>If all continues to go smoothly, (fingers crossed), I could be off within the week!  A welcome change from thinking it would be next month.</p>
<p>My bike is eager to be out on the road again. It's spent too much time in the van this past year.</p>

<p>It'll be a few more days yet before I'm listing the van on the car sales websites, but the van is for sale.</p>
<p>Big changes are afoot. It is not new year resolution stuff. I've been thinking about this for the past few months. Just have been sitting on the idea and thinking a lot. Also, with Christmas and New Year happening, I thought that it was not the best time to be selling. I have used some of the time to start cleaning up. I've just spent part of today going through all the stuff I've accumulated, (How'd I get so much?) sorting it into heaps - going with me, going to sell, going to give away, going to trash.</p>
<p>So, selling the van - what next?  A return to the bicycle and the tent. Time to hit the road again and keep exploring the country.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>When I bought the van, I'd decided it was time for a change. I'd thought long and hard about it. Bike touring isn't always bliss and pleasure, sometimes its really hard. At the time, weighing up the data, giving everything equal weight, a van seemed the best decision.</p>
<p>Where I failed, was the weightings of those decisions comparing living in the tent and the van. It was hard to weigh some of them without having had lived in a van before. Now I have, and looking back on those decisions, I weigh them differently now.</p>
<p>There are many good points for living in a van. Certainly some people are very happy living in a van. But for me, I don't want to keep doing it.</p>
<p>If home is where the heart is, then my heart isn't in the van. Its outside, under the sky, in the wind, rain, fog and sun. Hearing the birds, and the rustle of wind in the trees.  Feeling the rain drops on my face. Inhaling the sweet honey smell of the eucalyptus, sensing the cool riding into the morning mists. Its outside, active, being in the environment, rather than watching it pass by out the window.</p>
<p>I miss riding my bicycle.</p>
