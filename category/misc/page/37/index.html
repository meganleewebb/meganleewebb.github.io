                <p>Well, the start from Laverton, was cool and cloudy.</p>

<p>I had to get the phone out and check the gps that i was on the right road. After that little hitch, there wasn't any choices. The cold mornings continued, thought the days did warm up a bit more.</p>

<p>Makes the air so sweet.  No bees though. Think of the honey it would make... The first few days I had lots of people stop me and ask the questions. Was given some oranges a couple of times. One wonderful couple feed me well, and gave me oranges, apples, bananas, and some nut bars. Their bread, butter and honey sandwich, I almost pinched myself to see if I was dreaming. I was so yummy. I didn't, because I figured that if it was a dream, I didn't want to know. Was such a nice sandwich. The honey was from their local area, and I'd rate it as the best. The last couple days no one has stopped. The most I've had is people slowing down a bit and indicating if I'm okay.  Otherwise, days slipped by, just peddling away.</p>
<p>The grader crew where on the move. I found their work though.  First roadhouse: Tjukayiria. Was a welcome site. Had to try their Tjukayiria burger. Was so good, had another one. Was told that I was the first person to eat two in one go. I was hungry. I managed to fit another one in in the morning before leaving.  Martha, working there, kindly showed me about the local area.</p>

<p>One of the animals in the zoo. Can you see the elephant there? On wild life, I have seen some camels, an emu, and one dingo and one wallaby.  Someone would ask how the road is. Well, its a dirt road. Its got character. Some bits have a hard surface, others are really soft. But the secret is to ride on the hard bits. Sometimes I've had to walk for considerable distance looking for a hard bit. I was planning to average 80km per day, but with the cold mornings and short days, am finding that even that is a struggle at times. Fortunately with all the cold, water isn't a problem. I'm carrying 24liters, leaving the road houses, and its well enough to get the distance done. Could even stay on the road a day or two extra.  I'd still say that this is the best road I've had in WA.  Will be in Warburton another day, then will head on up the road. Will be no reception for sometime again.</p>

                <p>Been a wet, cold day. Was a balmy 15C overnight, and very windy. Then early this morning, the temperature dropped, and the showers started. And so it continued on and off all day, interspersed with drizzle. I wasn't expecting to make Laverton today, but had a tailwind, and I had to keep pedalling to stay warm.  Passed a few mine sites today, and a refinery. Was interesting to see small wind mills on top of the poles, with solar panels underneath. Guess it gets windy out here.  Started seeing the car wrecks on the side of the road. The number is only going to go up from here.  Staying in the caravan park tonight. Luckily it has a camp kitchen: a dry, warm, and out of the wind place to hang out in.  Applied for the permits for the Great Central Road at the visitors centre, and got them. Leaving in the morning. Will be no mobile reception until Warburton, about 550km away. </p>

<p>Hi Megan, it was an honor to meet you in the Laverton caravan park. We fossickers are in awe at your pluck! For solo travel I carry/wear a little satellite tracker you can see at FindMeSpot.com In MY case it kinda tells the kids on a daily basis "Sorry no inheritance yet" but it does allow the crowd back home to see whether I'm still moving or not and where I've got too. You could also check out Delorme's InReach which is better that FindMeSpot because with that you can craft a message in the field, such as "I need and inner tube" whereas Spot only facilitates the triggering of messages saved and stored (preloaded) before the actual need arises, Spot messages can only be altered while you have internet access.

<p>I just thought that I should add an explanation to any other watchers of Megan's blog about internet access between Laverton and Alice Springs. Where Megan has gone there will be NO phone or internet coverage for most of her next segment. One of our fossicking  club members, on his way into Laverton, stopped to chat with her many Kilometres from Laverton and she was travelling well. So for the next little while no news is not bad news.  That is what Megan was referring to when she wrote "no mobile reception until Warburton" She was taking 24 litres of water with her.(erniethecabbie@hotmail.com)</p>

                <p>Well, the stay in Kal was good, but being on the road again is even better.</p>

<p>Lots of history about here. Though, most of it seems to be signs - something was here before. In this case, a town, now its just a mine site. With all the mining boom, it seems like the the towns are dying. Menzies, the road house has closed down, there is a pub left.</p>

<p>Leonora didn't feel that alive today either. Streets empty. Few people stopping at the servo for fuel.  I've hit the school holidays. 4x4, with families, some towing caravans all heading north. Got mugged for the faq questions a few times, before they all piled back into their cars and drove off. Met one couple with their small child, they'd driven from Perth for the weekend. Out to look at some sculptures past Menzies. 1600km round trip for the weekend. Needed to be back in Perth Sunday afternoon. Thats a lot of driving for the weekend. But then I look at the mining work out here.  Wether its driving the workers out to the mines from Kal, or trucking the ore hundreds and hundreds of kilometers for processing or shipping. There isn't any reason to stay in the small towns. Not when you can live in the city and drive out. The small towns just slowly die as more and more services leave.    Had some fun the other afternoon. I got to play tag with the showers. I'd pedal as fast as I could, helped along by gusts of wind just ahead of the rain. I'd just stayed ahead. A quick stop for a drink and bit of a rest, and the showers would catch me up again. I'd pedal and get away before they could wet me. This went on for 30km. Eventually I was out flanked. A cloud from the side got me.  Next morning managed to play the same game with the sun bursts through the clouds. Well, till the sun went to do something else.. Sometime in the last couple of days the cycling with all my touring gear has gotten easy again. Since leaving Perth it had been hard work. I guess my fitness is back up now. The area still surprises me. I was expecting cold nights and warm days. Getting the cold nights, and then cold days. The days with the showers were trying. 10C, a strong wind, and then showers.  But it will clear up in a few days. Then I'll probably not see any rain for a long time.</p>

                <p>Second day out of Leinster was one of those magical days. It wasn't too cold overnight, so an early start was possible. The day topped out at 18C, but even better,  there was a tailwind! The first in weeks. I flew along. 75km in three hours. A quick food stop in Lenora and back on the road again. Had to use that tail wind while it was happening.  Then, at 90km a ute had stopped on the side of the road.</p>
<p>"Want a lift to Kalgoorlie?"</p>
<p>"You bet!".</p>
<p>Couple hours of interesting conversation later, I'm loading my bike up 25km from Kal, when the farmer that owned the land on both sides of the road drove up. Not only did he give me his dentists number,  he also let me camp on his land overnight. Bonus!</p>
<p>Kalgoorlie-Boulder has a lot of dentists. But there is large waiting lists for all of them. That dentist didn't have any appointments in the next two weeks, but next morning when I arrived in Kal, I found Smile Dental Clinic that did.  And even better,  they had one that day. Case of being there at the right time.</p>
<p>I decided to find somewhere close to stay for the night and Di at
<a href="http://www.weslanaccommodation.com.au/">Weslan Accommodation</a>
was very very helpful. If your ever in Kalgoorlie-Boulder and need accommodation, check with Weslan.</p>
<p>The dentists, there were two who looked at my gob and x-rays, couldn't find any obvious problem. In the end they ground a filling down a bit as they thought it was a bit high, and suggested trying a nasal decongestant in case it was a sinus infection.  The nerves for the teeth are close to the sinus, so infection in the sinus cavity can show up as tooth pain. Was my nose running? Of course, its been so cold and dry my nose runs constantly! They did find other work that could be done, (Doesn't that always happen?) but with no new appointments for three weeks, I've decided  not to stay. Will book an appointment with a dentist when I'm on the east coast again.</p>
<p>So, tomorrow I ride back up to Leonora.  I sure will not see a tail wind for that trip. It'll be a case of making friends with the wind.</p>
<p>Bit worried still, but loaded up with nasal decongestants, asprin, panadol, cloves, and other pain killers. Will just ride. If it blows up, I'll sort something out.</p>
<p>I wonder if needle nose pliers are the best sort to have...</p>

                <p>Paynesville Cemetry has one grave stone.. And he was killed in 1899. But on his gravestone, it is only written 99. That will catch someone out one day..</p>

<p>Its also amazing that at the same spot, George Ellis used to have 20acres of fruit trees and garderns, supplying fruit and veg to passing travellers. Where did it all go? Could do with some fruit and vege about the area.. Sandstone is a lovely little town. Had a wonderful tourist information center there also. I bought two dead tree books. One by a guy that tramped about the goldfields. He puts me to shame. He walked more in a day, than I'm cycling some days..  The other book on Bicycles in the Bush. Its really good.. All about bicycle use in rural Australia. Lots of fantastic info in to. The weather has been cold.. Ice on the tent each morning, so I don't get out of bed util the sun is up. Lots of reading time:)</p>

<p>Headed into Leinster from Sandstone. Its a mining town. Got a great all you can eat buffet each evening. I certainly gave it a work out. Lots of salads and fruit. Yum yum.. Also a day to do washing. Last wash was in Mingenew and it rained. The hot shower certainly felt good. The plan from here was to east, but i've a tooth that is causing me some discomfort. Since Dentists will be few and far between heading east. Okay, there will be none until Allice Springs. So I'm going to head to Kalgoorlie and find one there first and then decide what do to. So a fast pedal south.. Into the cold.. Hopefully it will not be a headwind all the way..</p>
