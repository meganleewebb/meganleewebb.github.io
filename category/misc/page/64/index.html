<p>Long day. 90 km.Tired me out.Wonderful riding again.Hearing the birds,the wind in the trees.I rode with butterflies.Glad i've the bike back.Gears make it heaps better than the single speed.And i needed all the gears!I need to lose weight though-me as well as the gear i have.At the moment all the shift has been to my stomach and the to the waist. A longer update when i get to an internet cafe. On to Denman'ish area today.</p>

<p>Leaving Sydney yet again. This stop over was much shorter - less than a week.If you compare the bike photo from this time to the last time, it obviously has been on a diet. (Unlike me) This will be third time lucky. Will be trying to update the web site more, using a mobile phone from my brother. Its a Nokia 6120 Classic. Lets see how it goes.</p>

                <p>YES!!! I've my bicycle back :) Soo happy..  My bike has forgiven me. Well, it is extracting some revenge. Breathing is laboured and my bum is tender - but this will pass. The joy of riding again will not though. So much better than on the motorcycle.</p>
<p>I'm so lucky that Claire kept my bike for me. Thanks also to Claire for giving me back a rack to be able to leave Sydney now. I ordered another Tubus Cosmo, but it has not arrived yet. So I've the old one off Claire, and she will get the new one when it arrives.</p>
<p>Trip to Sydney was a rush decision. Needed a break from my family, and wanted to get my bicycle. Had some other stuff to sort out, that I could have in a pinch have sorted without being in Sydney, but that just gave me an excuse to come down and get my bicycle, rather than wait for it to post up.</p>
<p>Not been able to catch up with all the people I wanted to. Kind of hard to fit it in with friends working. So, sorry to everyone I didn't get to see.</p>
<p>Heading out of Sydney tomorrow morning.</p>

                <p>Bicycle absence symptoms became too much. After brooding about it for a few weeks, and riding the motorcycle about - I'm getting my bicycle back.  Well, soonish.  I now rate the motorcycle as one of the silliest decisions I've made. Missing bicycling too much. So, if I'm not able to get to every part of Australia that I'd like to because of riding a bicycle, then so be it. That still leaves a heck of a lot of country to see. And in the end, I'd rather be bicycling and miss seeing things, than not cycle.</p>
<p>I've very very lucky that my friend Claire convinced me to leave my bicycle at her place, rather than sell it. So lucky!  Before my bicycle comes back, it is going to get an small upgrade. Yeah, going for some gears this time around. The guys at
Cheeky Transport <sup><a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> for http://www.cheekytransport.com.au</sup>
(Adam,Dave,Nic,Lee) are going to sort that out.</p>
<p>What I miss about the bicycle? Heres a list in no particular order.</p>
<p>Pedaling, the sense of achievement when you arrive at your destination, the slower speed, being involved with your surroundings,  picking up useful things (some people call this junk!!!) from the side of the road, spotting the things on the side of the road, seeing everything, the sounds of the countryside, feeling the cool air in the hollows, the gentle breezes, feel of rain falling, being warm when its wet, exercise, being able to eat all you want, not having to stop at service stations (once upon a time, you might have gotten service, now all you do is pay for the lack of service, and the petrol), not using petrol (I don' t know about you, but the smell of petrol isn't on my "nice" smells list), doing the best with where you are, the sound of your cleats clicking in, wind on your face, ease of jump on and off, being able to lift it over a fence,  the silence, not having to wear earplugs, being able to eat all you want, whirring of the free wheel, remembering the journey (you remember the hills that you struggle up, the corner when you were tired,  the view when you top a hill), downhill thrills, the tired feeling after a days cycling, hearing the birds</p>
<p>Well you get the idea.. Lots of good things..</p>
<p>I miss my bike. Hope it forgives me.</p>
