                <p>Arrrrgggh, it was cold last night. I managed to camp on top of a hill, but the frost on the ground told the story. A fair bit of standing in the sun, hands under my armpits, talking to myself like a pirate. This was to be the last cold night though.  Just outside Broggabilla, it was a balmy 8C overnight.</p>
<p>A quick run through Goondiwindi for shopping. Then on northwards.</p>
<p>Leaving Goondiwindi, I managed to miss the turn off, maybe it was enjoying the tailwind. I've been along the road too many times, something wasn't right. Stopped, checked the map. Yep, missed the turn off. Bit later, I was sure I was on the right road;  narrow, no shoulder, lots of truck traffic and roadside rubbish. Yep, going the right way now.</p>

<p>A good time was had. With help, my charge system is back working. After years of outdoor use, a mini to micro usb adaptor, was rooted

.  Must be corrosion somewhere in it. Was still giving out 5V but zero current.  The mobile would ping to say it was charging, but then slowly go flat.  Ordered a new adaptor, and will improve my charging setup.</p>

                <p>My sleeping bag needs more feathers in it!  Been cold the last few nights. Just below zero, with frosts. Been wearing thermals, clothing, jumper and the rain gear, and it's still cold. My "winter" gloves aren't. My thick socks aren't thick enough. I sleep huddled up like a pill bug, trying new ways to get more layers of my sleeping bag around me.</p>
<p>But after the sun has comes up, it's all forgotten; beautiful sunny, warm days. Who could want for more?</p>
<p>I've managed done dirt roads along the way. The old farmer that stopped told me I was lost. I wanted to believe I wasn't. I had suspected it was going to get interesting when the road became two wheel tracks. But as it as heading the right way, all seemed all good. Later I had to back track and return to the tar. Not bad, a 60km trek about the farm roads. Would have been only 20 km if I'd stayed on the tar.  But where's the adventure in that?</p>

<p>Ah, nothing like the smell of Roundup in the morning. A farmer spraying, and I get a misting as I ride past. No weeds on me!</p>
<p>I take the non direct route to Barraba. It takes a few days. The mining has expanded and the road has been closed permanently. I flag down a mining vehicle, and am told there is an alternative path around the closure. But the driver wasn't sure. The maps I have haven't been updated and provide no help. With no signs to guide me, I return to another route.</p>
<p>Along the way I pass the Rangari automatic telephone exchange. Would have been the heights of modernisation once..</p>

<p>Relaxing dirt roads. Blue sky. A gentle breeze. Next to no traffic. Who could want more?</p>
<p>Packing up next morning I found what looked like a scorpion. Didn't know Australia had any, but we do!</p>

<p>Easy riding mostly. I was heading to Coonabarrabran, but the flat plains and head wind did me in. I turned for a tail wind and flew.</p>
<p>Small towns, slowly dying. Shops closing, buildings for sale. Won't be long before there will be nothing left but a locality sign.</p>
<p>Camping in the bushes I walk through a spiders web. Just were did the spider go?</p>
