                <p>Eventually had to leave Wilmington. Headed to Orroroo. Decided to use the GPS and try the suggested bicycle route. It was certainly low traffic and I thought very scenic. It was also 30km longer than the road, and had a good tour de hills of the region.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Did I mention it was dirt. Well, it some places it was grass, no one had been down the road in so long. Certainly was a nice ride. The down side was that with the cold morning, I left late, and then arrived in Orroroo very late.  The lady at the newsagency was nice. But, if you end up down that way, stop in Peterborough, or Wilmington. DO NOT stop or stay in Orroroo. I didn't enjoy the stop in Orroroo, that is all I'll say about the town. I found out heading to Peterborough that there is a free camp on that road. I did ask about free camps, but was told there are none.  If I'd known... Left very early next morning. Broke my don't get up under 5C rule. Was worse as there was a morning fog as well. But by "sun up" (sun didn't actually shine until way late in the day) I  was cycling towards Peterborough and then onto Broken Hill. Was over cold, wet and winds, and more than a bit annoyed over Orroroo, and didn't want to find more towns south like that. I also wanted to see trees again.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Though the trip to Broken Hill didn't have a lot of trees. Lots of space though... But tough for winds. Strong winds were forcast for several days. I was going to stay in Broken Hill until they passed, but then I spoke with the wonderful lady in the information center. There were lots of accomodation options, but Broken Hill is on the Country Link rail network. Rode over to the train station, and dealt with the very very helpful Trevor, at the Country Link booking office.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Few hours later I was wheeling my bike onto the Indian Pacific and resting in a very comfortable chair. Only 16 hours later, after a  good sleep, I wheeled my bike off the train in Sydney. Indian Pacific train is not a Country Link train, but the bookings are done at the same place. I don't recall the price of Country Link, but $168 seemed to me to be a bargin. Definitely recommend travelling with them. Now I'm in Sydney.</p>

                <p>Left Woomera with forcast Northerly winds, and had a slow three days down to Port Augusta. Lots of opinions in Woomera about the recent mothballing of expansion plans at Roxby Downs. Didn't stop long in Port Augusta. While the traffic from Woomera down had been heavier, arriving in Augusta was overload. The usual bike lanes that vanish just when you need them. Diversions for cycle riders that direct you, and then fail to direct you anywhere else, leaving you wondering just where you are. I didn't need to do much of a shop, as i still had a lot of food from a big buy up in Coober Pedy. I got overly excited about the huge amount of choice in the IGA there and bought way way too much food. The stop in Woomera only put a slight dent in it. So I stopped at Stoney Creek Bush Camp Caravan Park, Wilmington to try a bit harder. Well, not just that, it is back cold and damp again. Crickey it's cold!!  The caravan park is well off the main roads, very quiet and I was allowed to put my tent up in one of the camp kitchen areas, so was out of the wind and showers. So nice and peaceful. Also, I must admit, I've been having a bit of a crisis of decision for the last few weeks. This has reared its self now about which way to go. I'm not sure about wanting to stay bicycling and tenting about the country. Some of it is definitely related to the long distances between towns out this way, and all the difficulties that causes, and of course the cold, wet weather. Of course there are many other reasons and its not a simple decision. There are a lot of things I like about cycling and tenting. But there is stuff that I'm starting to miss. I'll expand more on this another time. For now, I'm heading back to Sydney. I'm leaning towards getting a van, but still not sure if that's a good decision. Its still 1500km to Sydney, so lots of time to contemplate that option. For now, the I just need to decide which route to take. Go via Broken Hill, with lots of space between towns and maybe less traffic, or via Renmark. More towns, but definitely more traffic, and maybe colder?</p>

                <p>I did some tourist stuff. Actually really wanted to see the rockets.</p>

<p>And I found some. There is also other military gear on display also, like this missile.</p>

<p>This was in front of a fenced off area of all the bits of recovered from the Simpson Desert.   Other than the tourist stuff, lots of hanging about doing not a real lot. The usual stuff - eating, washing, repairs, and of course: baking!</p>

<p>Still feeling really excited about bread. Especially flat breads. Something about mixing the dough up, that is so simple, yet has lots of room for variation. Also like the hands on moving the bread about the plate and flipping over to cook the other side. Haven't geeked out the process at all. Still not using any measures, just eyeballing the amounts in the mixing pot, and judging the cooking time on the amount of heat off the stove.  This kitchen stove was not as hot as my MSR. Sometimes I get it wrong, but learning...</p>

<p>Hi Megan, I am really enjoying your cycling about adventures, now to become cycling/vanning about? Ha ha. In a way that is what I would like to do too as in I've been challenging my self to unplug and just leave (Melbourne)..... So your blog was found at a perfect time and it is very inspiring.</p>
<p>And so is this bread making adventure. So much so that I would love a recipe/hints on how to start getting into a rough ballpark with it. The photo above looks very tasty indeed.</p>
<p>Take care for now</p>

<p>Hi again Megan, just another thought came up regarding your bread... what are you cooking it on? I have a little gas stove and it is excellent but have come across this stove http://www.solostove.com/  recently and it makes a lot of sense in as much I would have endless fuel with no cost and importantly no gas cartridges to waste/recycle (which is difficult on the road). I'd love to know your thoughts.</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>Miro</p>

<p>Hi Miro, I cooked on a MSR Whisperlite International stove. On the last photo, there is that aluminium plate under the bread - that is what I use on top of the MSR. The aluminium plate is nothing special - its actually the cover plate of a solar hot water system. It looked useful, so I carried it for 18 months, before I started using it as the cooking plate for flat bread :)</p>
<p>For the solostove: I used MSR Whisperlite Internation as I run it on Shellite, but could run it on Petrol if needed. Fuel for the MSR is always available.</p>
<p>With the Solostove, depending where you travel, you may not find twigs, only grass, or nothing at all that burns. How does it go when its raining and all the twigs are wet? If your thinking of stealth camping, the smoke and smell of burning wood might be a give away. It may not be legal on total fire ban days either. Think of how you'd use it on all occasions, and how you'd carry after its out, and if it works for you...</p>

                <p>Bailed on Coober Pedy, and lucky day I did too. Left town at 10am with a roaring tail wind. 120km done before I knew it. The first 100km was very barren. Nothing higher than ankle high. Would have been slow going in a headwind. Was so happy to see the bushs and trees start again. Almost got off and hugged them.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Actually I did hug a tree when I stopped for the day.. Yep, I'm a confirmed tree hugger.  Met another bicycle rider on the road. Kerry on his holiday, cycling up the Highway to Darwin. He was in a hurry, so didn't stop long. I wished him always a tailwind. While he had it that day, the next was a different story.. Lots of caravans on the road. A few wide loads heading north. Wonder if this is for Coober Pedy...</p>

</a></p>
<p>Yesterday was a tail wind! I averaged just over 30km/hr. Rode 170km before calling it quits. It looked like rain. Lucky I stopped then. I just got the tent up in a dip in some sand dunes when it did start showering. Even better, as I found this morning, 4km up the road, the landscape returned to barren. Nothing higher than ankle hight again. Would have been a bad place to stop and put up the tent. A crook night was had. Something upset my stomach. It played bongo drums all night, and periodically wanted out.  That really affected the sleeping. Energy levels this morning were not high.. Fortunately the tail wind continued until i was 6km from Woomera when it strengthened and moved. Slowest ride into a wind I'd ever had - just above walking speed. From the side was getting blown about the road. Luckily no trafffic. So taking shelter today. The weather station observations has it down as 50km winds at the moment. Even standing outside is unpleasant.  Lucky for me, I'm standing in a camp kitchen, clean, warm and dry. Will have to rest here another day til the winds die down a bit before moving it. Time to check out the history of the place..</p>
