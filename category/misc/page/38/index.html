                <p>Paynesville Cemetry has one grave stone.. And he was killed in 1899. But on his gravestone, it is only written 99. That will catch someone out one day..</p>

<p>Its also amazing that at the same spot, George Ellis used to have 20acres of fruit trees and garderns, supplying fruit and veg to passing travellers. Where did it all go? Could do with some fruit and vege about the area.. Sandstone is a lovely little town. Had a wonderful tourist information center there also. I bought two dead tree books. One by a guy that tramped about the goldfields. He puts me to shame. He walked more in a day, than I'm cycling some days..  The other book on Bicycles in the Bush. Its really good.. All about bicycle use in rural Australia. Lots of fantastic info in to. The weather has been cold.. Ice on the tent each morning, so I don't get out of bed util the sun is up. Lots of reading time:)</p>

<p>Headed into Leinster from Sandstone. Its a mining town. Got a great all you can eat buffet each evening. I certainly gave it a work out. Lots of salads and fruit. Yum yum.. Also a day to do washing. Last wash was in Mingenew and it rained. The hot shower certainly felt good. The plan from here was to east, but i've a tooth that is causing me some discomfort. Since Dentists will be few and far between heading east. Okay, there will be none until Allice Springs. So I'm going to head to Kalgoorlie and find one there first and then decide what do to. So a fast pedal south.. Into the cold.. Hopefully it will not be a headwind all the way..</p>

                <p>Yalgoo was a small town. Its claim to fame is the church. Design and built by a priest.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-church-769721.jpg" >
<img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-church-769721.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The weather was kinder on the way to Yalgoo, but while I was in town, the smell came on the wind; petrichor. The scent of rain.  It started raining a few minutes later.  Temps have been about the 10C mark. Without the wind, its pleasant. With the wind it's shivering time. I was told in Mullewa that I was on the road at the right time. Several of the mines have shutdown for upgrading. So the number of trucks on the road is way down. One guy said that they averaged 1500 a day. This seemed a lot, but then today in Mt Magnet, a local was saying he counted 70 in an hour. At 130 tons each, its a lot of stuff moving about. Anyway, there are less trucks right now. So, the road crew is doing what road crews do: patching the roads.  We passed each other lots. Road work is happening from Geralton to Mt Magnet.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Mt Magnet, didn't stop in town long. Feeling restless and liking being out camping. In town feels busy. I stopped at the shop, and spent a lot of time talking with people. The daily paper delivery to the shop was running late, so everyone was hanging around waiting.  Lots of mining workers about in town and on the roads. Most look young. They don't wave when we meet on the road. I wave, and they stare back with bovine indifference. The locals, and most truckies wave. Sometimes I get a blast on the horn. Some trucks horns are way underpowered for the size of the truck. While the last few days has been warmer, the forecast for the next few includes lows of 0C and frosts.  Going to be nippy. Today, after lunch, it was a sweltering 20C.  The weather, what can you do..</p>

<p>It can get very cold in the Midwest region (and very hot too!)</p>
<p>I love the Mingenew and Mullewa areas and wish I were there, but will wait until spring. That's when the wildflowers are at their peak. No wonder they call it the "wildflower country").</p>
<p>Wishing you happy and safe travels. Lucky you!</p>

                <p>The days over the weekend were quiet. Not a lot of traffic on the roads, and the towns were like ghost towns. I did start to wonder if anyone was still living in them. Not a sole to be seen. I'd roll in, find some water and roll out.  Had my first over 100km day in a while. Wanted to stop at the 80km mark, but no where to camp. Low lying land, with out any bushes. With the recent rain, it was also damp. When I did find a spot, it was near the road, with old tin cans scattered about.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-1-751162.jpg" >

</a></p>
<p>From days when tinnies where really tin. Not sure if the aluminium cans will rust away. Mingenew was the first populated town. It has the distiction of having the largest grower supplied grain store in the southern hemisphere.  Last year over a million tons was harvested. So much that some had to be discarded, there wasn't any storage left.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p4-3-752889.jpg" >
<img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p4-3-752889.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Its also in the area for wild flowers, but I'm about a month too early for that. With all the grain, you'd think it would go by rail.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The building looks too small and dated. And the rail like is too. Trucks rule the transport here, following the unused rail line into Dongara. Todays ride, Dongara and back. A nice 80km mail run. I didn't warm to Dongara at all. Was happy to get the mail, but, it was too busy. The Brand Highway passes through it. Lots of road train traffic, then all the caravans and camper vans. I had my tent out drying in the park. Council worker come to tell me I couldn't camp there. All the taps have no handles. And the servo's charge for air. The only thing anyone could tell me to see was the marina.  In the end, to touristy for me. I headed back out to Mingenew. Its been fine the last few days. Going to miss it. Rain is forcast again.</p>

                <p>Well I left Perth with a severe weather warning. Gales of up to 125km/hr expected. So another change of plan was needed. Instead of going up the coast, I started inland a bit. Still it was windy. When windy, trees are not your friends. The best place is sheltered behind a dense bunch of shrubs. My first night I thought I'd found the best spot. But someone else beat me to it</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-IMG_0450-709747.jpg" >
<img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-IMG_0450-709747.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Couldn't move them, so hunted about and found another spot, not as good. It wasn't as bad a night as I was expecting. Toodyay was the first town I stopped in. It looks the place that gets lots of visitors on the weekend. Monday morning, it was very quiet.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p4-IMG_0451-711490.jpg" >

</a></p>
<p>The next few days were uneventful. Pedallying, and hiding from the wind at night. Though, it wasn't that windy.  Then I let my guard down. That night it was windy. I'd stopped not quite on a hill top, but sheltered behind some bushes. I checked later. Winds were over 60km/hr that night. And the thunderstorm. I was bounced about in my tent like a pea in a drum. Lightning was striking within a few km of my spot. I was trying to decide how much insulation my sleeping mat would provide if there was a strike nearby. I decided not enough!  That was a sleepless night.  Working on that it couldn't happen again, I stayed in the same spot the next night. All batterned down ready and it was dead still. The farmer nearby was out. All night had the drone of machinery as he worked the fields. Big empty fields out here. Wheat, barley, oats...</p>

</a></p>
<p>Passed through the town of Bindi Bindi. There isn't much there. Not a shop, petrol station, or park. A few houses and a war memorial. Was some art work on the way though.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p8-IMG_0453-713730.jpg" >
<img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p8-IMG_0453-713730.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Miling was a nicer place. Chatted with the owner of the shop, while having a large serve of hot chips. Favourite would have to be Watheroo. Woke up to clouds and fog, but then the day turned into sun and blue sky for the first time in ages. Rolling into town and they had a park with benches and tables. Water tapes even. Sat down, dried off the tent, cooked breakfast, read for a while and soaked up the sun.</p>
