                <p>Yaamba turned out to be nice roadside stop. The pub had a good feed on also. I couldn't bring myself to stop in Rockhampton. The only shops i saw was in Stocklands shopping complex. Think of a brick with doors.</p>
<p>I had planned on stopping at Marlborough and did initially. But the town so annoyed me i left. Had to pay for water there. The pub or the shop would not give me any.It takes my worst town award. 151km to St Lawrence it was. I arrived at 6pm.A much nicer place. Been resting today. Might move on tomorrow.</p>

                <p>Well Banana had only two servo's, and a post office. No big or little bananas.Since i'd arrived early (8am), haven riden since 4.30am i decided not to stay and headed to Wowan. It wasn't that nice a place when i arrived. And the only person i saw wasn't that nice, so i headed to Dululu. And there i stayed as that was 140km for the day. I was tired.</p>
<p>This morning i left early. It was a no moon night. The milky way was visible. Oh so beautiful! I twisted my neck a bit looking up and around.</p>
<p>Just before Westwood the Leichhardt highway came to an end. I'd riden the whole length of it. I was sorry it was over.</p>
<p>Rockhampton- not nice. The drivers are bad. Heaps of traffic.Noisy. I'm missing the country roads.</p>
<p>Stopping in Yaamba today at 120km. Enough for today.</p>

                <p>It showered today. Its cooler. And hopefully this cool weather will continue. Tomorrow is an easy 60km to Banana. Reckon it will have a giant banana?</p>
<p>I ate up well today again. My chickpeas sprouted. More yoghurt. Corn. And some biscuits.:)</p>

<p>Have i seen this range before?</p>
<p>Resting in Theodore now. Days and nights have been baking hot and humid. Rode during the night to avoid the sun, but it was still hot. Where's the cool?</p>
<p>Have started using Areogard as had so many mossie bites i looked like a plague victim. Now i bath several times a day in the repellent. Is this the same as washing?</p>
<p>My clothes and me have not been dry for days.Constant wet cloths, the humidity, get smelly fast.With mossie bites, wet clothes, and i'm looking thinner i get lots of personal space at rest stops.</p>
<p>You can eat 2 minute noodles with out cooking. They are yummy!Even the flavour packets are good-but some are hot and spicy.Save them for the baked beans.</p>

<p>Well the last few days have been pedal, pedal, pedal. Into a headwind the whole time. Been doing 100km days.Long and slow.</p>
<p>See if you can spot the difference on the from and to photos. Big empty spaces. The headwinds keep the flies down though.But watch out at night, the mozzies are bad. I sleep to there buzzing - outside the tent.</p>
<p>Been camping by the road, but today a combo of tired and needing a wash, have had a short day. To celebrate 1000km tomorrow, i've my first shower in Qld. The clothes got washed also.:)</p>
