<p>I found breakfast on the road this morning. Courtesy of the semi-trailer that went past earlier. The bird was definitely fresh road kill. Didn't get much off it; two bits the size of oysters. I'd have thought it would have been tender, having been hit by a truck, and being a young bird. Maybe it was my cooking technique. It was a tough chew...</p>
<p>It didn't add a lot in calories either. Need to find bigger road kill.</p>
<p>Burren Junction is a dead town. The shop closed last Friday. The servo had shut. Only the pub is left. I only stopped at the rest area out of town to cook breakfast, then headed towards Pilliga.</p>

<p>A steady cycle along the dirt road into Collarenebri. Given it was Sunday, not much was happening. I did stop briefly at the aboriginal cemetery. Looked pretty western to me.</p>
<p>Collarenebri is a dry town, as in no alcohol. The cemetery is out of town.</p>
<p>I didn't stay long, headed out towards Burren Junction.</p>

<p>Mungindi, the only town straddling a border in the south hemisphere to have the same name on both sides.</p>
<p>It's a small town, but has two police stations, one in Queensland, one in New South Wales.</p>
<p>I noticed the signs going south about fishing licenses required in NSW. That explained why all the fishing was happening on the QLD side of the river.</p>
<p>But keeping rabbits, is way more costly in QLD!</p>
<p>Not sure if it was state rivalry or not, but was told I could only get water on the Qld side. Since I needed to go that way, I didn't argue. But I do think they were pulling my leg.</p>

                <p>Arrived early, after a night of thunder, lightning, strong winds, and a little rain. Found out later that I'd missed most of it; 25mm had fallen in town. This was to cause me some problems when I wanted to leave.</p>
<p>Wandered in to Unique Egg, thinking to look about the sports gear, and found it was a tourist attraction on its own. 60 years of hand carved emu eggs. Spent time talking with Steve Margaritus about his life in Australia, and the eggs he'd carved. Was very interesting. Might go back and talk more with him another time.</p>
<p>St George was smaller than I'd though it would be. I didn't stay long. Food then water, and headed out.</p>
<p>St George has the water systems: rain water, bore water and river water. Mostly people drink rain water, wash in bore water, and water the plants with river water. Yes, some off the taps give out river water. Noticeable from the muddy color.  I declined to buy bottle water, and eventually found a drink fountain near the river to fill up at. I suspect it is bore water, but had signs up saying it was drinkable. It is!</p>
<p>I'd planned to take the dirt road to Dirranbandi, but after the rain, and locals saying it was probably all mud at this time, decided to stick on the tar. In the end it didn't matter. At the turnoff, the wind was blowing so strong, I decided to have an easy time, and not ride into a head wind. Stayed on the road towards Nindigully.</p>
<p>Stopped off just before the Nindigully Pub, and sheltered from the wind. A peaceful night was had.</p>

                <p>Surat was a lovely town. Rolled before lunch. Showers from the overnight had eased, but it was still cloudy. Sun trying to peak through.</p>
<p>I used the time to find some water and wash the mud off my tent and ground sheets. Also washed my sandals and socks. The mud out here is very sticky. Clogged up the tires also. I took to carrying a stick to scrape it out. I would have washed in Roma, but I couldn't find a tap at all. Even getting drinking water was hard. Didn't like Roma much - too big, lots of mining traffic, everyone in high-viz gear. And traffic lights!</p>
<p>Two locals in Surat went out of their way to come and tell me about the camping options and free showers in town. How sweet is that!</p>
<p>Cause I didn't use the showers - I'd washed in Charleville.</p>
<p>I went to look at the camping. It was a very nice site near the water. But, lots of caravans about. I've been spoilt: too much camping on my own. Loaded up with water and headed out. Found a lovely spot just for me later that day.</p>
