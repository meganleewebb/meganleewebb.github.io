                </h2>

                
                

                <p>A lot has happened and not much at all since the last update. I've also put off doing an update with other things happening. More on that at the end.</p>
<p>I was sitting about Perth doing some preparation stuff, and a lot of procrastination. Perth was surprisingly relaxing for a city. So was easy to just go with the flow and drift into days of doing, well not much at all.  There was a lot of lazing about reading, cause I finally bought an ebook reader.</p>
<p>In November I bought the
<a href="http://www.sony.com.au/product/prs-t1">Sony WiFi Touch</a>
ebook Reader. Oooh I like it. I got white, figuring that would absorb less heat in the sun when outdoors. The reading experience in daylight is really good. Never again will I be without a book to read!</p>
<p>On a wifi connection I could browse the internet and download and read free ebooks. What I could not do was buy a book that used Digital Restriction Management (DRM), download it to the reader and read it on a wifi connection. DRM books need a pc first. Maybe this will change if or when Sony opens their Australian ebook store. But that is not the end of the problems for DRM.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I got the Sony over the Kindle was that the Sony supports epub books - the open standard, that everyone except Kindle supports. You buy a Kindle and you can only buy your books from Amazon. Your locked in. Want to read that book on a non Amazon device - well you''ll have to buy the book again. Buy a Sony (or any non Amazon ereader), and you can buy books from a number of sellers and you can use those books on any other reader (except the Kindle).  You get the picture.  One thing the Kindle does hide, is DRM. You don't see it because you cannot read your book anywhere else except on the Kindle.  But its still there. DRM means the book you "buy" isn't yours. Your buying a licence to read the book, and that's it. At some point that licence can be taken away from you. This has
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/168654/amazon_removes_ebooks_from_kindle_store_revokes_ownership.html">happened</a>
on the Kindle.</p>
<p>I tried DRM books on the Sony to see how it worked, and then decided to do the sensible thing and NOT buy any more books that use DRM!!!  Sounds drastic, but isn't. Aside from how I feel about DRM itself, the using DRM experience is too annoying, and problematic for me. Adobe runs the DRM authorisation, so you need an account with them. You can download and use their software or use the Sony library software. I started with the Sony software that come with the reader, but also downloaded the Adobe software as well. What ever you do, you will need an account with Adobe. You probably will also have one with Sony, as you have to set that up to register the reader.</p>
<p>Thinking back on it now, you can probably do the whole thing with just the Sony software, and the Adobe account. I stopped using the Sony software early on, and started using the far superior
<a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>
software to organise my ebook library. The Sony software was to me, limited, and clumsy to use. Calibre has way more options for organising books, and a far better interface. Calibre doesn't support DRM as that is only available from Adobe, but it can be used to copy a DRM book onto the ebook reader.</p>
<p>I was using the Abode software. You buy the book. You want to read the book. The file you get isn't the book, its a ticket to get the book. You load this into the Adobe software, and then you get the book. But you can't read the book, until you use it on "authorised hardware". You use the software to authorise the pc, then you can read DRM  books on the pc. To read the DRM books on the ereader you authorise the ereader. This is letting Adobe know that a certain PC and a certain ebook Reader are connected to your account; a list of what your allowed to read books on. Note: at this stage, that is two authorisations. You only have six authorisations in total for an account. As I travel, I have to remember to revoke authorisation of the PC if I authorise it, as there is no way to revoke an authorisation remotely. To revoke an authorisation, I had to google to find the keyboard combination, that brings up a hidden window to deauthorise the PC. The software from Adobe doesn't have it as a menu option. If you authorise a PC, and the hard disk dies - well, that is one authorisation you cannot revoke. You now have five left. Er, four, because you need one for the ereader. Buying the ereader, doesn't give you an authorisation. That can only come from Adobe. Same thing if the ereader breaks or is stolen.</p>
<p>Since the Sony reader has come out, it has had some updates available for it. One of the early bugs would hang the reader, needing it to be reset. You didn't lose your books, but the authorisation was lost. I'm not sure if that used up an authorisation or not. There is no way that I can find to get a list of how many devices you have authorised. I had to reauthorise the ereader again to be able to read the DRM book I had on it. On the road, without access to a PC, a reset would mean that I couldn't read that book. If the reset is using up authorisations, then I'm one down already. I only had the problem once, and fortunately that bug has been fixed, and I haven't had to do that again. But I still can't tell how many authorisations I have left.  Once all the authorisations are gone, so are your books. You might have the file, but the words are encrypted, so you cannot read them. Luckily I'm not attached to that book.</p>
<p>See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>
for some of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Controversy">controversy</a>
on DRM. It applies not just to books, but to music, videos, games, etc..</p>
<p>I'll stick to non DRM books. Fortunately there are a lot of them. Besides out of copyright books that are DRM free (and often free of charge), there is a growing number of authors and publishing houses that sell DRM free ebooks. Yes you still pay for these books, but your buying the book - its yours to keep and read forever and no one can take that right away from you.</p>
<p>Currently I have over 800 DRM free books loaded my my reader, and still I have not used up all its internal storage. I don't think I'll run out of books to read for a long time...</p>
<p>Enough on ebooks. Support DRM free books.</p>
<p>Back to other matters:</p>
<p>I'd decided to stop loafing about Perth and start doing some cycling down south of Western Australia while I finished my tent. Plan was to leave stuff in Perth, only take the barest essentials and keep working on the tent as I go. More incentive to finish it when the mossies can get in..  There's now a special place in my heart for tent makers. It seemed so simple lying on my mat looking at it. How hard could it be? Not really hard, but long and time consuming,  and lots of compromises, that I hadn't thought about until I hit them. Trying to get the one perfect tent is not possible. Don't try it!</p>
<p>It was a Saturday, and I was all set to cycle off on the Tuesday, when got a call from family. A family member had a fall, sustained a head injury, and was in hospital having surgery. Instead of cycling out out of Perth, I packed up everything and I flew to Cairns.</p>
<p>Head injuries are tricky things. Recovery will be long and slow, and maybe not back to the stage before the injury. For now, we all wait and hope that things go well.</p>
<p>Since arriving, I've been staying close and trying to help out as much as I can. Doesn't feel like much, but I'm sure that it counts. I'll not be here permanently though. Mean while, I'm back to working on the list of things I hadn't finished in Perth, and planning a route south for when I leave.</p>

                <p>Finally decided to act today.</p>
<p>I'd noticed that someone had been using various online forums to post anti [anything I have ever supported] comments using "Megan Webb" and "Megan Lee Webb" of Dulwich Hill. They have also posted pro comments for issues and groups that I would not lend my name to.</p>
<p>Friends has asked me at different times if that was really me posting.  No, it wasn't.   Its just my most ardent fan.</p>
<p>I suspect they will continue to show their commitment in the future, so anything you read that isn't on this blog - it wasn't me.</p>

<p>Was out walking, smelling the evening meals,  took this photo. Walk past this place often and the roses smell soo wonderful. Find the time :)</p>
<p>Bike is in the shop getting a new set of bottle braze ons. This will allow me to carry the fuel bottle for the stove outside my bags. Still working on the tent - well, procrastinating about working on it. Need to sew the mossie net, and all the sewing people I've spoken with have said the material is too fine. Borrowed a sewing machine - but it didn't work - the machine, not my sewing. Trying to find a way to avoid having to sow 34 meters of joins by hand.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the weather outside after a few really hot days, is cool - autumn cool.. So wonderful!!!</p>

<p>Still in Perth. Out riding about the bike paths, found some cute graffiti.</p>
<p>Rohloff hub is back getting looked at. The seal change didn't fix the problem. While the shop was looking at the issue, they found the frame dropouts were twisted. I now have straight dropouts, but the hub is still leaking. Also found that my headset bearings could have been better - got them changed to a new set that have o-ring seals to keep the water and dust out. Wow! That was an improvement. I hadn't noticed how bad the headset was. Motivated by these this improvement, I changed the front disk rotor. The previous rotor didn't want to stay straight. It was once, but guess it got banged and bent. It was never the same after that. Bending would work for a while making the wobble less, but sooner or later it would get worse again. Got tired of it and changed the whole rotor out. No more pulsing brakes! Now that was an improvement. I wonder why I waited so long to do this.</p>
<p>The last of the glue arrived so its back working on the new home. There's a picture of the space I have to work in. Bit squishy. I do the glue work in the morning, so that by evening I can move it and sleep in the same space. While more space would make it easier, I'll get there in the end.</p>

<p>Still hanging out in Perth. Been doing some short rides, lots of reading, playing mindless computer games, and procrastinating on things I should be doing.  However I haven't been totally idle.</p>
<p>Critical Mass Perth is dead. I hunted about online but couldn't find any activity since 2009. In the end I turned up on the steps outside the Western Australian Library on the last Friday in September,  but didn't see any gathering.  After waiting about for half an hour I gave up. I reckon its dead.  Someone prove me wrong...</p>
<p>Lost another tooth. It had been sore for several months, but not agony sore, so I'd been ignoring it. Well, not just that, there aren't many dental services in country Australia. Finally after procrastinating a lot, I saw two dentists here.  Both said the same thing - root canal or extraction. Given that root canal costs upwards of $2000, extraction it was.  Another one gone.  Dental costs in Australia are incredibly high.</p>
<p>Been thinking of doing a long walk while I'm over here. Was looking at my gear and the weights of everything and decided to get a smaller cooking pot. Also tried out making a Penny Stove. The stove works well, but not sure if I want to use metho or not. I've gotten to like the MSR Whisperlight International - turn it on and cook for as long or as short as needed. Measuring out the metho and lighting up, sometimes I burn out before my meal is done, other times I burn way longer than I need. Metho produces less heat than Shellite or petrol. Hence means more fuel needed. Prices for a litre range from $5 upwards. (found some for $3 in Bunnings, but as Bunnings only exists in large cities, I'm not counting on this). Shellite, my prefered fuel, is about $7 a litre, and petrol is about $1.50ish.  But metho has its uses, I'll keep testing and then decide.</p>
<p>Riding about in the city on the weekend and found Perth Pride Fair day was on. Advertised as "fun for the whole family". They claimed over 40 stalls, but I'm doubtful about that.  It was in a small park, fenced off, with bag searches and a $15 entry fee. Needless to say I didn't go in. Talking with the locals, in past years it was free, then a gold coin donation.  I wasn't the only one that declined to enter. Some thought the entry fee was to ensure they didn't have another one next year.</p>
<p>Been house sitting a friends apartment.  Not much space on the floor, but I've been using it to make a new shelter. Still haven't finished, but finding the building is going real easy - well apart from the constant shuffling about on the floor. To replace my existing tent, I'm going to change to using a 8'x10' (2.4m x 3m) tarp. Making the tarp from 48.4 g/m² Cuben fabric. No sewing involved. Using tape and glue. It will have no-see-um mossie net and bathtub as well. The mossie net will have two entrances, and no zippers. Zippers work well, until they break, then they are a head ache. Going to try having extra material and twisting it shut. Trying to keep everything simple and easy to repair on the road.</p>
