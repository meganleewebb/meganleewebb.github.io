                <p>Had enough resting in Texas. The weather had returned to showers, so time to move on. Left Sunday morning in the rain. Later in the day the sun came out and it was hot. Tar melting hot. Tar was running like honey in some spots.  Rested in Ashford for a while- most of the mid day actually. Then stopped about 20km outside of Inveral for another few hours.. Slept beside a hay field. Oh did that smell nice.</p>
<p>More showers on the way..</p>

<p>What a week it has been..</p>
<p>I stopped a couple of days outside of Aratula. The second hand shop there, the guy gave me a book, so  I had to stick around to read and and drop it back. While there, I saw a koala in the wild!!!! The koala climed down one tree, ran across the ground and up another tree. Did this a few times before finding a tree it was happy with.</p>
<p>After leaving, it was a two day climb up over the range. The road I picked had signs saying no trucks, semi trailers, caravans or busses. Some of the grades were 17%. Needless to say I walked lots of it. It would have had great views, but mostly I was struggling to see more than 20meters - fog or mist or clouds. It was cold and wet, wet, wet.  It took two days to climb the range.</p>
<p>Stopped in Legume, and Liston for a night each.</p>
<p>I'm currently in Texas staying in the caravan park.  Yes. There is a town called Texas in Qld.</p>
<p>Memorable moments;</p>
<p>If a tree falls in the bush does it make a sound? You bet. At 9:15ish at night, I went from sleeping to crouched ready to run in one heatbeat. A very loud "crack", followed by the sound of  falling. In the morning i found some small twigs had hit the tent. The dead tree fell towards the tent, but the top of the branches stopped about 10meters away..</p>
<p>Digging a hole in the rain forest is hard work - lots of roots.</p>
<p>From Killarney to the NSW border, the road is called "Border Road". at the border, in NSW the road is called Killarney Road. QLD likes having the roads called Border road. Same thing happened when crossing again on the way to Stanthorpe.</p>
<p>Texas has sheep farming- lots of flies. Dig any hole early in the morning before the flies wake up.</p>
<p>New top speed - 79.5km/hr. Might have been faster but i put the brakes on early on.. But then lost a water bottle the speed crept up before I knew it..</p>
<p>Rain stings over 50kn/hr.</p>
<p>Being wet each day has its problems. I wear the same clothes each day. I've only three sets: one to wear, one to sleep or change into and one spare. So if one pair is wet, and its still raining, they go back on the next day. I found that I have lots of little blisters or boils. Any small cut would easily become infected.  A day of being dry has helped them a lot. Clothes that are wet constantly smell. In short before washing today - I stunk.  Going past road kill, the flies would all leave to follow me. I had so many on me, I'd chase them off to make the uphills easier.  Fair dinkum!!!  Skin softens in the water, and I found small pills of skin in the tent. Any callouses I had are long gone.. But after all of it, one good wash and everything is gone. I smell clean again, my clothes have the soap and sun dried smell. Looking foward to sleeping tonight - a clean dry bed.</p>
<p>The blue Ortlieb bags have shown a problem. The top is closed by a roll down, but the edge has a cloth strip. This strip soaks up the water and lets a few drops inside. I'm going to spray silicon on it when I get some to stop that. For the moment I'm double bagging to stop my sleeping bag getting damp.</p>
<p>The panniers on the Yuba Mundo work well. I feel like I can ride faster than with thee Go-Getters. Its also easier to pack and unpack the bike. Its also easier to push the bike up hill - the wide loader bar isn't in the way. The panniers sit a few inches higher  - which is a big help when crossing water. I walked through water up to just below the axle height. The go-Getters would have been in the water, and lifting the bike. Water that deep has a lot of force. I wouldn't like to walk through any deeper flowing water...</p>

<p>koala in a tree</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Picture taking has been limited in the wet. My phone isn't water proof, and mostly I was so wet, I didn't want to risk opening the water proof bag to get out the phone.</p>
<p>After all the rain - it isn't as unpleasent as you might think. It does make for some changes, like stopping earlier to give the inside of the tent time to dry, or taking longer to setup and take down the tent.. And when the sun comes out its so magical.  Riding in the rain is easier in some ways - its cooler, and there isn't any water shortages :)</p>

<p>Left Brisbane at 5:39am - the first train out. I had intented to use the Google maps directions for walking to leave Rosewood Station, but the paths and sometimes roads where not there. Ended up going down roads that turned into dead ends. Some had fences across them - suggesting that they might have been open once..</p>
<p>It was good being out in the country smells again - grass, gums, and cows. No road kill yet.</p>
<p>Checked out all the cemetarys I passed. Lots of dead people, passed awy, some are resting, others were "called" (Why do they answer?), some "gone to a better place" (What didn't they like about this one?)</p>
<p>The day was overcast, and warm. Spent three hours eating lunch and reading. Then started being more serious about getting somewhere. With a full stomach, it was slow pedalling.</p>
<p>Stopped for a drink at a fence gate, and one of the few cars I'd seen stopped. They owned the paddock and were going to do some fencing. We talked for a couple minutes. They offered that I could sleep on their property. So I cycled in after them and helped them with the fencing. As we were moving along the fence, I found the best spot to camp. Little stream trickeling in the background, lots of birds.</p>
<p>Woke up this morning to birds singing.</p>
<p>Pictures; Tried different packing strategies. The great outdoors!! A model of a church that once existed in the cemetry. (Wonder if the church had problems with snakes?) The morning tent view </p>

<p>Still hanging out in Brisbane. Been doing some house painting- and old Queenslander. Also been waiting on a toy; a folding wireless keyboard. Lets me type blog updates on a real keyboard, rather than thumb typing on the phone. Still a small bit of painting to finish then I'm out of here and heading south.</p>

                <p>Hanging out with friends on the Gold Coast now. Been very surprised about the cycle paths about Brisbane. They have much better facilaties than Sydney. Good paths that go everywhere I wanted to go. Clear signage. Maps. So awesome.</p>
<p>Ditching the GoGetters for panniers. About 7kg weight there. Wow. Also loosing the wide loader bar. Caught my foot on it a couple of times on rough roads. The panniers hang higher, which is a bonus:better ground clearance.</p>
