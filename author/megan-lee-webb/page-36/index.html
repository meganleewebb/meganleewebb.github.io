                <p>After leaving Far North Queensland, I decided to travel back to Barraba for a bit. Arriving in town on Thursday morning, I walked about asking if anyone knew of any volunteer, casual or part-time jobs going. Well, within the space of an hour, I was hired.</p>
<p>It was to have been an easy casual position: waitress/kitchen-hand. But that quickly changed and I found myself with the title 'Manager', planning, directing staff, and making changes.  Looking back on the time now, it was fun and exciting. Long hours but ultimately rewarding.</p>
<p>I was only to have been working for a couple weeks, but ended up extending my time to a couple of months.</p>
<p>If your ever travelling up near Barraba, phone up and book a lunch, or stay at The Playhouse Hotel

                <p>After missing the cooler weather down south, I traveled south. And got cooler weather in abundance.</p>

<p>-8C  Definitely cooler.  Found lots of exciting things: throwing water on the windscreen was a bad idea - it just froze and just made the ice layer thicker.  Wiper blades froze onto the windscreen and don't move. The water washer also froze. Ice is very abrasive - I now need new windscreen wipers..</p>
<p>The taps outside froze solid - so check for running water before taking off your clothes for a shower.  My van is unheated - so stuff inside froze also.   More than one blanket was needed.  Getting up and running to the shower block in thongs was guaranteed to give you frozen feet before you arrived.  Leaving the shower, wet hair froze on the run back.</p>
<p>Was an interesting experience.  One that I'm not that keen to repeat.</p>

<p>I like cool times, but sub zero temperatures - I just don't have the gear for enjoying it.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Not seen too many of these about. Nice bike though.</p>
<p>Heading north, I didn't linger anywhere. The trip was very uneventful. Just days of driving. Not very interesting.  Lots of road trains about:</p>

<p>I'm now up north, sweltering in the winter temps: 22C overnight, 86% humidity. Daytime temps have hit 27C.  I miss the cooler weather down south.</p>

<p>Well its cooler up high. Temps been dropping to 3C overnight. And had a few light showers. No problems in the metal tent for water getting in, but it has been a bit tough getting up and moving early.   I have found condensation down low in the van - on the bottom of bottles and tins in my storage system. I'm not sure if this is from my breathing in the van - without the window open, or just from travelling from low areas to high areas with cooler temps, and not adequate ventilation to dry it out. I opened out the storage area and it all dried up, but the next night it was back again. Will need to keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>After the cooler weather, I dropped down to the coast for a night near Byron Bay. Much warmer at 18C.  Seemed lots of angry people about when I was lunching in the park. Guys yelling aggressively at one another. Pushing, shoving, name calling, lots of expletives. Uncomfortable to be around, so I didn't. Diving out, passing the servo another blue in progress. Yicks - what was it with Sunday?</p>
<p>Now staying with friends for a few days on the Gold Coast before deciding if to just head up the coastal road, or to track inland for a bit.</p>

                <p>Well, time to farewell Sydney again and head north. First stop for the day is my old favourite: Broke</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/broke.jpg" >

<p>A bit or history for the place. Its certainly a lot smaller now.</p>

<p>Found the above information board near the new bridge Looking at the water flowing underneath, I dare say it was probably a lot deeper back in those days. At the moment it looks like you could hop across without wetting your feet.  The bridge is high off the water, so the floods would be a sight to see.</p>
<p>I left Sydney after the morning peak hours rush was over and this time it was a lot less busy getting out. The trip still took me four and a half hours driving time. Yeah, I wasn't rushing at all. Stopped several times for a break.  Just cruised along gently along the Putty Road. I thought it was very scenic.  Day dreamed about cycling along it.. I still having bicycle withdrawal symptoms. Still got my bike with me in the van though. And do get out and ride it. But not the same as days touring. Trade offs...</p>
<p>Time is a passing. And this clock says it all:</p>
