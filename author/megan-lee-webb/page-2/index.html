                <p>Decided that needed to move on from Manilla. Was a nice town, but itchy feet. The day was windy and dusty, so thought I might as well be walking northwards. It was very windy and dusty on the road. Almost headed back to Manilla. Had decided that I'd only stop in Barraba for water, but when I got here, thought I'd stay the night. One night led to two, to three... Been here more than a week so far.. Going to stay a few more too. There is the Barraba Festival on in the first weekend in November - so will probably stay for that. I'm staying at the Barraba Caravan Park. (Hi Bob.) Its quiet and peaceful.</p>
<p>Exciting things that have happened - I cut my hair! This is the first time in I don't remember how many years. So it was a good cut. I used scissors first - but the cut was uneven. Then in a second had shop I found some hand clippers for only $10. Bargin. I was so excited. Today, for the first time all week, my hair is even. Number 000 clippers - pretty close to a shave without using a razor. Not sure yet if I'll just stick to the clippers, or actually do the shaving. Time will tell. It certainly is a change from my long hair. Dries quick though, and is easier to wash. Also saves on shampoo and conditioner :)</p>
<p>Days are passing watching the insect life (there are lots of ants about here - all different sizes, shapes), playing with the Roly Poly's (
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae</a>
they are soo neat!!) , watching clouds, and reading. I also go for rides about the town and local roads when it is cool.</p>

                <p>After the quick update at Nundle, I headed up to Hanging Rock. The plan was to head to Barrington Tops. However, it was cold!! It was midday when I got up there, had lunch at a place called Shiba Dam (Had a picnic at Hanging Rock), and I was shivering. If it was that cold at midday, I thought the nights might be too cold for me, so I headed back to Woolomin. Took me 1.5 hours to walk up to Hanging Rock, and 5 minutes to coast down. I did camp one night at Nundle, and found ice on the tent in the morning when I woke. Woolomin was cold, but not as cold.</p>
<p>So for the last three weeks, there has been lots of shivering! Still getting rid of stuff - down to just a pair of sandals now - got rid of the shoes I had. I've never liked shoes that much, so not sure why I thought I would suddenly start wearing them now. Gone. 1.5kg lighter (they were heavy shoes!!)</p>
<p>The other thing about Woolomin was that Merv and George had all these books. The General Store had books also, so I did a lot of reading while I was there. George went ferreting on the last weekend, and brought me a rabbit skin. I wanted to try brain tanning it. Well, I learnt alot about hides - fleshing the hide wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. After several hours, cramps in my hands, holes in the pelt, I admitted defeat. I know for next time - start with a more comfortable handled knife, a hard surface to work on, have water handy, and probably start on not such an old rabbit. The pelt was from and old female and was very mangy. But still for a first try, I was happy. No I didn't get to the tanning stage. Next time. Though then I'll have to catch the rabbit myself.</p>
<p>For interested people, here is the link on how I was going to do the tanning: http://www.braintan.com/articles/furs/miller1.html</p>
<p>I was in Tamworth yesterday, but had internet problems so didn't get an update.  I'm now at the Manila caravan park. And it is a nice park. My lesson from yesterday is 'drink water'. I set out from Woolomin about 8, got to Tamwoth at 9:30, did postal stuff, internet, some shopping, and then set out. About lunch time cramps started, and I struggled on to Manilia before thinking about why. Realised that I'd only drunk about a liter all day, and the day was very dry. Also had a head wind the whole way. (Why is it that when I stop the wind goes the way I want to head, but the moment I start riding I get a head wind?) Decided that I'll rest up here for a couple of days to recover before moving on.  There are also more books here to read :)</p>
<p>Sorry to all the people that I've got email addresses for that I've not emailed yet. I keep forgetting and packing the address book at the bottom of the bags. Sooner or later I'll rememeber and keep it on top.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day not shivering, and now the weather here has gone cold :( Hope the washing dries - my jumper is in it.</p>

                <p>Well packing up an exhibition was interesting. The paintings were 'wow'. Doing the work, was thinking of how to make it easier. It took all day. Also got to been some of Ians friends in Tamworth - Hi to Col, Kate and Molly (How could you forget Molly!)</p>
<p>I cycled out of Tamworth on Tuesday morning, and got to Woolomin. The rain started there, so camped in the camp ground. Well next day was the dust storm - so wasn't going anywhere. The local shop has books that you can take and read - so spent the past week sheltering from the wind and dust, reading books. Been taking the tent down in the day - and sheltering underneath it to cut the wind down. Oh I'd like the wind to stop!</p>
<p>This morning was 1 Degree. With the wind, its cold. I'm going to wait about for another couple of days for this cold front to pass, and the weather to warm up. There is a forecast for 30C on Wednesday or Thursday. Just heard that its 8C now, and that doesn't count the wind!!! Not sure about Barrington Tops either at the moment. Everyone is saying its always cold there. I don't think my clothes are up for the cold. The question I'm still thinking is wether to sit here in Nundle, or go back down to Woolomin where its a bit warmer.</p>
<p>I'm still not so good with taking pictures. So no pictures yet. Still getting rid of stuff on the bike, though, the items are small now -&gt; do I need this cloth? Still would like it to be lighter.</p>
<p>Been talking to lots of locals and tourists (as you do shivering in a campsite). By far the most common exclaimation is 'your mad' followed by 'get more gears'. But some people think its a good idea (even if they wouldn't do it themself)</p>
<p>Meals have settled down to once a day - doing a large rice/pasta/vege dish about lunch time, with any desserts if there are any. Eat any fruit when I can.</p>
<p>What ever I do, I'll be heading in Walcha eventually and will get another update up then.</p>

                <p>Yeah.. bit of a story. After spending 5 days camping in Watagans National Park. (I had a good time there.. no one else was at the camp sites - guess they are all working) I moved to Wolombi Pub for one night, then went to Broke. Camping in both places. Broke was a nice camp site, but got too noise - with someone wanting to keep me company so I would be lonely. They also brought their juke box along. So next day was heading to Denman very early in the morning. A rent a van stopped, and a guy lept out and said to chuck the bike in the back and he'd give me a lift. Well I said no. But we got talking, he's an artist and was heading to Tamworth to collect his paintings from the exhibition that he'd been displayed at. Obviously here I am - been helping him pack up his paintings. Ian Bettinson is his name, and the paintings were worth it. Amazing dot paintings. Glad I accepted the lift. Been here a couple of days, leaving tomorrow. Going to cycle backwards towards Sydney to see some of the national parks I skipped.</p>
<p>I should also add that I've been dumping stuff every stop. Getting less and less. Pushing the bike up the hills, you think carefully about what you need. Will get another shot of the bike soon. I can say that there is now space in the panniers :)</p>

<p>Left Sydney Saturday 5th September for Morriset. Was sad saying farewell to friends over the past few weeks, and my home for the past year. Was exciting also to be finally on my way. I had lots piled on the bike. Panniers full to busting, a bag tied on top and stuff hanging off everywhere...  (Anna and Serena got up early just to see me off.)</p>

<p>So much stuff on the bike,  that first stop at Claires place we went though it all and I left another box of stuff behind - mainly clothes, and the yoga mat, thongs, etc</p>

</a></p>
<p>That reduced the weight a bit.. But by the time I got to Morriset, decided to ditch some more things. I think that managed to lose 6kg of stuff here. Decided that I didn't really need to take that extra shifting spanner (on a bike with mostly allen keys), multigrips (why??), and file (what was I thinking???).. or need so much food..(months and months supply!!!)  a container of grease (on a bike with all sealed bearings!!!), half the bookcase (maps of all of Australia - what was I thinking!!!)</p>
<p>The twin boys here are so cute. But so much work. Always busy.. been taking naps in the day when they sleep to recover. They just turn two.</p>
<p>Ingo and Andrea have been so wonderful. Love Andreas cooking!. But after sorting out more stuff on the bike, time to hit the road again.. Leave Sunday for the nearest National Park.</p>
<p>Time to hit the road.</p>
