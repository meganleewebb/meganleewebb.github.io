                <p>From Mt Surprise going west, a lot of road works.  Besides the currently worked sections, others have had what I call the "scrape and bake" treatment:</p>

</a></p>
<p>The edges scrapped back of all vegetation, and the black lane up the middle. Reminded me of a solar cooker. It feels it riding along.</p>
<p>Just outside Georgetown I got a flat :(  It had been a sleepless night with gusty winds. I'd started early, but then spent hours on the side of the road. The flat wasn't  puncture. I'd been told that I should run my tires at a lower PSI, so was experimenting with that.  I'll stick with higher pressures from now on. It looked like the bead of the tire was rubbing on the rim. It rubbed through to the wire, which then punctured the tube. It had been that way for a while - the wire was rusty and the rim tape was also stained. Closer examination showed the tube being slowly cut by the rim tape where the rust had stained it.</p>
<p>Lucky I had spare rim tape and a spare tire.</p>
<p>Except I couldn't get the tire to sit on the rim right. It would have a flat spot on it. That felt like a bump when cycling. Most uncomfortable.  Finally I worked it out. The old rim tape is about 17mm, the new one was 22mm. So I sat and cut with scissors 2mm off one side, and 3mm off the other side to narrow it down. Then the tire sat right.  No more bump or flat spot on the tire.</p>
<p>For all the time sitting on the side of the road, I still managed a healthy distance. The wind was still blowing, so propelled me along just nicely. The only downside was trying to keep cool; it seemed like I was cycling in still air.</p>

                <p>Left the coast angry and unhappy. Anger propelled me halfway up the range, but left me without worn out and tired the next day. A lot of walking ensured.  Usually when I'm up this way its wet and cold. That was not the case now.  Bright blue sky and baking sun. Oh for some coolness.</p>
<p>The range seemed to have grown from last time. For every up hill walk, there was a flying downhill coast. But that just meant another long uphill walk. Before long I was groaning with each downhill.</p>
<p>Just outside of Ravenshoe in the rest area, I met Geoff from Towoomba:</p>

</a></p>
<p>His Penny is from 1882, and travels with him. He was kind enough to give me a beer and a ride. Been a long time since I've sat on one, and I was glad to get back to my safety bike afterwards!</p>
<p>The next day it hit 32C. I suffered badly. Tiredness, headache, and then nausea feeling. It took a bit for me to realise that I wasn't drinking enough. Soon as I did, I was off the road, in the shade and force drinking.  Was a timely reminder to be aware of the conditions.  With the temps above 30C from now on, I decided on 30minute drink breaks. Been going well since then. Also toned down the effort so not sweating also.</p>
<p>Stayed a night in Mt Surprise. Met Shane - also on a cycle there. He'd started in Darwin. With a $10 a night camp fee for bicycles, I had to stay. Also ate four burgers and got to listen to Russels' snake talk.</p>

                <p>Well, tomorrow actually. So doing all the 'getting ready' stuff today.  But had to change a tube:</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2014/tube.jpg" >
<img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2014/tube.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The tire was a bit flat, so I put the pump on it and added air. Seemed like it was leaking about the valve, but then stopped.  So I rode about for a couple of days. Then a few days later, it was flat again.  Thinking a puncture, I pulled it out, and was surprised when the valve come away in my hand.</p>
<p>Looking closely at the valve, it looks like it never bonded well. I can push the valve stem into the hole and it does a good job of sealing it - but must slowly leak. Wondering if I can clean the metal up and use some glue and reclaim the tube.</p>

                <p>Out and about for a few days. Stopped at Gordonvale for lunch in the park. Nice smells in the air from the sugar mill.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Alternated from a damp fibre smell, to a sweet molasses. I imagine the locals are well used to it by now.</p>
<p>From Gordonvale, travelled into Goldsborough Valley. Only one short walk to some waterfalls, and then a nice 16km ride along the Goldfields trails. Pleasant weather - cool and no bugs.</p>

<p>Also spent a bit of time at Lake Tinaroo, where I found religion:
<a href="http://www.venganza.org/">Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster</a>
. After finding out about it, I had to know more. The more I found, the more I liked. This is a religion I can believe in.  Luckily for me, joining is
<a href="http://www.venganza.org/join/">easy</a>
, and its a very accepting religion.  I'm now a Pastafarian.</p>

                <p>Been here one week so far. Busy time; sorting out worn or broken gear, catching up with family, and doing some cycling.</p>
<p>If your heading to Cairns, you'll see the signs for Paronella Park along the highway.  I cycled right on past. Its got a bit of history. Read the story on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paronella_Park">Wikipedia</a>
, or go visit and hear it from a tour guide.</p>
<p>On the weekend went on a drive with a relative, and stopped at the cafe for a cup of tea.</p>

<p>The castle has had a rough time. Fire went though in 1979.</p>
