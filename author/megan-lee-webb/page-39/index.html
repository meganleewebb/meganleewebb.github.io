                <p>The new Exped tent was horrible. Was kicking myself for not checking it closely after getting it. In the new model, the mesh doors have changed to cloth. I can't see out, and it's warmer, not something I wanted. Needed to change it. Seriously needed to change it. Took a bit of effort, but now I've a MSR Hubba Hubba; the old style; the green one. Mesh doors and I can see out.</p>
<p>In the tent change over time, I saw a Doctor. Thought I had the flu, the nose was sore, but it wasn't like a flu in the sinus. Turns out its not the flu, but an infection inside the nose. On antibiotics that are working really well. I'm wondering why I put up with it for so long! Though, either the infection or the antibiotics are making me really tried. Only managed 50 km today. Will be taking it easy until it's over.</p>
<p>At a nice noisy camp near the highway tonight.Couple more before I find can get on some back roads.</p>
<p>Note: Burning Mountain rest area has toilets, but no drinking water. Fill up in Scone.</p>

                <p>Been a while since I've been through the Watagans. So leaving Sydney I enter again. Its changed a lot since last time. More signage.</p>

<p>These signs are about the camp sites.  Which are a bit funny as there are trees everywhere.</p>
<p>No trees fell on me.</p>

                <p>From the Six Foot track, I stayed in Lithgow to meet up with a friend for the weekend. After that, road to Glen Davis, then passed through Glen Alice, Rylstone,  Bylong and Muswellbrook. An easy ride to places I've been before. Was nice to be out on the road again. Predictably I struggled with fitness, but did manage a 100km day without too much effort. I needed to return to Sydney for some personal matters, but also because my gear was falling apart; tent leaking, stove leaking fuel and bike breaking spokes.</p>
<p>Black spokes; a mistake on my last wheel build. When wet, the water sits where the spokes cross, and they rust. Weakened, then snap at the cross over point.  New spokes are double butted, stainless steel. No rust!</p>
<p>Stove; I changed seals and wanted to get a replacement. Ended up getting a bit of an overhaul and more than one seal changed.</p>
<p>Tent; It was still under warranty. Exped replaced the tent with the newer version of the same model. Neat. Its a bit lighter as well.</p>
<p>So, that took care of the gear. I've done some house sitting, house repairs, and had a dose of the flu.</p>
<p>But now I'm back on the road.</p>

                <p>It seemed a good idea at the time... A non trafficked route to Jenolan Caves. Quiet. Scenic. The map showed bicycles allowed on it been Megalong Valley Road and Jenolan Caves Road. I could then continue touring southwards.</p>
<p>It's downhill from Blackheath to the track start. There I chatted with some walkers, returning from the Cox River. They were tired, having abandoned their walk to Jenolan and turned back.</p>
<p>In high hopes, I rode off. The first kilometre was on a road, then the track started. This was the last I rode for the next three days.</p>
<p>I expected some walking would be involved. Crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge involves stairs... The track was rough, narrow, rocky with stairs, fences and gates. Considerable effort was required. After a while I continued on in the hope it would improve. It didn't.</p>
<p>Portage over the rougher spots, stairs and fences involved up to six trips. The river crossing also was exciting. Do you carry over the important stuff first? Or gain practice first? Is anything not important?</p>
<p>I'd optimistically planned on making the second camp site, but was sufficiently exhausted to stay at the Coxs. The camp that night was quiet. I was the only one, after the last of the 4x4's left.</p>
<p>The road resumed from the camp site. It goes up, and up, and up. After four hours pushing up hill, I pulled the pin and walked back to the Coxs. I'd managed just over 1km/hr. It was hot, and I wouldn't have had enough water to get out. And at that point I was still less than half way.</p>
<p>No 4x4s when you want one..</p>
<p>The only alternative was back the way I'd come. 6.5km of it. While it was three hours down, going back would take longer as it would be uphill. It only took me 5 hours.</p>
<p>The ride/walk back up Megalong Valley Road seemed easy after that.</p>
<p>I'd say the Six Foot Track is a mountain biking track, rather than loaded tourer riding track. Though it would be easier starting from the Jenolan end; more hills from that side.</p>

                <p>Well, for a short time anyway. I've still been hanging out in Sydney. A few things are dragging on.  "End of the week". "First thing next week".  After a few times of this, all creditability has gone.</p>
<p>So, heading out for a few weeks ride and then will return and hopefully be done.</p>
<p>Was up at 3:30am - couldn't sleep. Wasn't leaving for another 4 hours, and most was packed. Packing up the tent, the only worry I had was "where did that spider go..."</p>
<p>Everything fits back in the panniers - so well, that I wonder if I've forgotten anything. So I grabbed a few extras just in case. Now it looks suitably full. Probably end up ditching the stuff later..</p>
<p>Due to quirks of Cityrail, travelling today (Sunday) has less train changes, larger cross over times at the changes and is an hour faster than travelling tomorrow. Cause, that all depended on the trains running "on time". Since
<u>
C
</u>
ityRail defines "ontime" as "within 10 minutes of the time table" it means that making connections is iffy.</p>
<p>Destination: Blackheath for the Six Foot Track.</p>
