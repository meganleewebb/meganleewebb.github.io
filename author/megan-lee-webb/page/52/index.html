                <p>Changing your bike again!!!</p>
<p>Yeah, been a few changes over the past year. Each time I thought it was the "right" decision. What can I say - I make some bad decisions.  But am learning :)</p>
<p>The Yuba definitely rides smoothly. Nice bike for cruising along. Also works well for carrying what ever you want. No worries about the strengh of the frame. Going to miss the solid no flex rack.</p>
<p>Am currently back on my old Aluminium MTB frame. The Yuba is on ebay and has offers so it will sell. Why the change? Number of reasons.</p>
<p>The extra length touring causes me problems. About town I can't get into some lifts, going through bicycle path squeeze points - it doesn't make it. I have to lift the back wheel up and move it to make it around. This also happens on the wheel chair ramps. The weight of my gear and the bike and the length don't make it easy for me to do this. Not I'm not in town that much, but the lifting and moving it affects me even in the bush.</p>
<p>Can't lift it over a fence easily. Noticed this more on the Lithgow trip with a friend on a standard length bike. Two of us managed, but I wouldn't do it on my own. (Actually, I can't lift the Yuba easily even when unloaded.)</p>
<p>I've no hope of getting it on a plane because of the extra weight and the length.</p>
<p>Yeah, the extra weight - noticing it more that I'm in Sydney. Places I've cycled lots. I expect to travel a certain speed and with the Yuba that isn't possible. Interestingly this didn't bother me in the country. So think its just I'm "back in the old places".</p>
<p>So after anguishing over it for a few weeks, its back to the MTB frame.</p>

<p>No not me!</p>
<p>While wandering about Sydney, I stopped to listen to Alex and Mish playing and singing outside of Broadway Shopping Center. Great music.</p>

                <p>Well arrived in Sydney on the Monday, and then left to go camping up near Lithgow with Claire. We rode a track towards Newnes. Twas a nice track. Had to unpack the bikes and carry the gear and bikes past a few obstructions. Lucky for two of us - the Yuba is a bit heavy for me to lift on my own over some things - like fence gates. Also with two, we were able to lift the bikes over other obstructions without unpacking them.  For a four day trip, I had a lot of failures in the footwear departmeent - my Shimano sandals and thongs broke. Both held together by cable ties quite successfully.</p>
<p>Now in Sydney - have started replacing or upgrading gear. Thermarest is in for a warrenty claim - its got a large bubble in the middle of it. Might go a lighter version or foam when or if it returns.  Need to patch holes in the tent. Replaced the crank puller with the way lighter Shimano version. 5mm thick steel  knife sharpener is being replaced with a 50gm version. Folding knife that doesn't lock shut is being replaced with one with a better lock so it stays shut when it should.</p>
<p>Aslo culling over weight items. 0.5kg of paper converted to pdf.  0.5kg bag of string chopped to just one piece for the clothes line. Clothes that are too worn but still carried are discard and replaced.  "spare" clothes that never been used  have been given away. Spare fuel bottle is gone. Keeping the 650ml bottle only.  Blue Ortlieb bags are gone - cut down enouth bulk to shove everything into the panniers.</p>
<p>Had 26kg when left Brisbane - thats before food and water and includes pannier weight. Will see what it all weighs when I leave Sydney next. Will be about for  couple of weeks.</p>

                <p>Left Bylong early on a cloudy day and was riding to Jerry Plains. But on the way I met Graham from
<a href="http://www.jamesestatewines.com.au/">James Estate Wines</a>
out for a ride. We rode along and chatted. Graham also rides mountain bikes. He suggested I stop in and say Hi to Jan, as their cellar was open that day. Glad I did. I met up with Jan when I was in Stonehenge. She was on a bus going to the Birdsville Races. She didn't get to Birdsville, because of the rain, but I didn't know that.. Stayed and chatted for some time. Ended up leaving with a bottle of Verdelho. (Had some last night - it was good. Everyone liked it.)</p>
<p>Further down the road I found I missed the turn off I wanted to take. The Golden Highway was busy, with no shoulder at all. After half a km, I wasn't keen to keep going towards Jerry Plains, so turned back and ended up heading to Muswellbrook. Much more pleasant road to ride on. The only down side was the strong head wind all the way. It was a pedal down hill day.</p>
<p>Muswellbrook has City Rail trains to Sydney. But, only a few trains a day. I arrived at 4:30pm, the next train was at 9:00pm. From there to Hamilton to wait a hour for the next train towards Sydney at 11:37pm. Sydney City Rail service has a few weaknesses; no staff, no station announcements and no indicator boards. Past the time that the train was to arrive, a train arrived, and I foolishly got on it, only to find that I was heading back towards Muswellbrook. Bailed out at the next station, and rode back to Hamiltion Station. One of the first times I've used my mobile phone and Google Maps to navigate about in suburbia. The next Sydney train was at 2:38am, but it didn't arrive on time either. Arrived at Morisset Station close to 4am. Since I often wake about this time, and had had no sleep, I bunked down on the station bench until 6am for a short nap.</p>
<p>Currently visiting friends at Morisset for a few days, before heading to Sydney.</p>

                <p>Christmass day:birds singing, water rushing. Memories of childhood christmass days. Food, rest. Watched the couple near by move their baby about all day - to get it into the shade, closer to where they had moved their chairs. Designer baby. Straight from Toyota land.</p>
<p>There was a sudden heavy down pour, but then it fined up again.</p>
<p>Set off early on Boxing day with overcaste weather. Planned to stop in Ulan. Hit a new Top Speed: 81.86km/hr. Down hill obviously.</p>
<p>Ulan has lots of mines. Air smelt of sulphur.  Was raining heavy when I got near there. Decided to keep going.</p>
<p>More driver silliness: Saw a car pulled over - but disappointingly saw that they stopped to add more rum to their drink.  A 4wd packed with young males, speeding along a rough dirt road. Bouncing, slipping or skidding, airborne, stones and water flying out the sides.</p>
<p>Even with all my gear on the back, the back wheel can lose traction on wet clay. Most unsettling.</p>
<p>125km for the day. 8hours pedalling time.</p>
