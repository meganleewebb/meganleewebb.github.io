                <p>Pleasant days. Baradine is a lovely little town. The temps are good. Scenery easy on the eyes.I linger in the bush, reluctant to leave. Twice I'm back in town to get more water, my camp is on a ridge and the creek below is dry. I read and make a net from builders twine. I watch the birds, ants, beetles and occasional roo as the sun swings its arc overhead. Must I leave?</p>
<p>When the water runs out again, I ride into Coonabarbran.</p>
<p>A Woolworths! So much food. The man setting up the garden section sees me and says where to lean my bike, and that he'll watch it. So helpful and friendly. I buy way to much, not having had breakfast yet..Never shop when hungry! A lesson I know, but ignore.</p>
<p>I find the clocks have changed. "Daylight savings" has started/ended. The day light looks the same to me.. I wonder what happens with the savings.</p>
<p>Now sitting in the park; eating.</p>

                <p>Time for a wash. Pilliga has a public hot spring. Actually it's a bore that empties into a pool.</p>
<p>When I arrived, the park was busy. Lots of caravans, motor homes and campervans. Well a lot compared to how many I'd seen recently. I rode up, took my sandals off and walked into the pool. Figured my clothes needed a bit of a clean also. The water comes out of the bore warm, and with a salt content. I was hoping it was less than what was on my clothing. Only stayed in a bit, then out to dry off.</p>
<p>Temps have been trending upwards, so it didn't take long to dry. I interacted with a few of the visitors. Apart from one couple, parked noticeably away from everyone else, people were not happy. Grumpy would describe them. Not sure why.</p>
<p>I was happy. Fine day, a wash, food, water. I didn't stay. While there was a lot of room, a spot on the first was already reserved for me. Off down the dirt road towards Baradine I went.</p>

<p>I found breakfast on the road this morning. Courtesy of the semi-trailer that went past earlier. The bird was definitely fresh road kill. Didn't get much off it; two bits the size of oysters. I'd have thought it would have been tender, having been hit by a truck, and being a young bird. Maybe it was my cooking technique. It was a tough chew...</p>
<p>It didn't add a lot in calories either. Need to find bigger road kill.</p>
<p>Burren Junction is a dead town. The shop closed last Friday. The servo had shut. Only the pub is left. I only stopped at the rest area out of town to cook breakfast, then headed towards Pilliga.</p>

<p>A steady cycle along the dirt road into Collarenebri. Given it was Sunday, not much was happening. I did stop briefly at the aboriginal cemetery. Looked pretty western to me.</p>
<p>Collarenebri is a dry town, as in no alcohol. The cemetery is out of town.</p>
<p>I didn't stay long, headed out towards Burren Junction.</p>

<p>Mungindi, the only town straddling a border in the south hemisphere to have the same name on both sides.</p>
<p>It's a small town, but has two police stations, one in Queensland, one in New South Wales.</p>
<p>I noticed the signs going south about fishing licenses required in NSW. That explained why all the fishing was happening on the QLD side of the river.</p>
<p>But keeping rabbits, is way more costly in QLD!</p>
<p>Not sure if it was state rivalry or not, but was told I could only get water on the Qld side. Since I needed to go that way, I didn't argue. But I do think they were pulling my leg.</p>
