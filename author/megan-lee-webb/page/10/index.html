                <p>Holey dooley, Townsville is going flat out!  Stopped for a breakfast on The Strand just on sun up and for a quiet spot of brekkie. But it was not to be. First was the guy with the whipper snipper. He left and noise was still settling down, when the edge trimmer strolled past. He was followed a short time later by the dreaded leaf blower. Peace now? No, the leaf sucker was next.</p>
<p>Finally some quiet?</p>
<p>No.</p>

<p>A monument to turtles of the past, while their smaller offspring are harvested in the background.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The turtle harvesting commenced on the beach. Once they were large, big enough for two men to pick up and carry away. Now they are a lot smaller, and it's faster to harvest them with machines.</p>

<p>Megan, what is turtle harvesting? Are they adult or juvenile? And are they being harvested for food? This disturbs me a lot!</p>

<p>So excited. -You beauty! I won the cake! And a six pack of beer, but who cares about that. I won the cake!</p>
<p>I'd picked up coins today on the road, and when I counted them had $1. The Lions raffle was on, and the couple coming around asking to buy tickets. Tickets were $1. I knew it was mine:- I'd found $1.</p>
<p>Of course I won, else I would be so excited, eating cake and writing about it! Still, it's exciting :-)</p>

<p>Been slow to leave Cardwell. Bruises on my legs needed time to heal. The calmness and scenery have also played their part..</p>
<p>I won't miss the sand flies though. They are well fed now.</p>

<p>Well, 5 hours later, I'm back where I started in Cardwell.</p>
<p>The day before rode over a hill to see two cyclists on the road! Wow.. Need to catch them. And I did for a bit. But I think they didn't like my music, and soon pulled away. We met up again and spent the night at a caravan park in Cardwell. They are riding for
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/breakthecycle2015?fref=ts">Break the cycle campaign 2015</a>
.  Great stuff. We talked long into the night. Was really glad that we'd chanced to meet up.</p>
<p>We rode out next morning, but my destination was Long Pocket. Will and Safi were off to Ingham.  Unfortunately the "road" to Long Pocket closed in 1881, and is now a very rocky walking track. Never letting that stop me, I spent an hour pushing up hill before admitting defeat having covered less than 1km. Running out of water also, and pretty stuffed, battered and brused, I returned to Cardwell for the night.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldQrapQ4d0Y">lyrics from the Toby Keith song</a>
were running in my head;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Now my body says, "You can't do this boy"
But my pride says, "Oh, yes you can
I ain't as good as I once was
Thats just the cold hard truth'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it wasn't a wise decision to have tried that. Now I'm bruised and sore. And will have to take it easy for a while to recover.  I've also reconsidered my plan to head to Charters Towers by a similar route, that would have involved much much more climbing.</p>

<p>Not caught up on all my posts yet.  And I'm getting ready to shoot through.  Just been just off playing tourist for a bit in the past week.</p>

<p>Headed out west. Stopped to watching the <a href="http://www.savannahlander.com.au/">Savannahlander</a> pulling in at
<a href="http://www.mbahistsoc.org.au/locations/location-almaden.html">Almaden</a>, the end of the line.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Then onto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillagoe,_Queensland">Chillagoe</a> for a walk about the rocks and ruins.  And a surprise catch up with
<a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-03-uluru-ayers-rock/">
Stuart and Thomas
</a>
of baking fame back in 2012 on the Great Central Road. They were travelling with Robet. Bit of a shock for Thomas, yacking away in the beer garden of the pub, talking all about me when I walked in, sat down and heckled him.</p>
<p>Not surprising he didn't recognise me out of my cycle gear. He'd only ever seen me like
<a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-19-my-first-damper/" >this</a>.  Impossible to know if I had hair, let alone style and colour.</p>
<p>Stayed an extra day, eating delicious bacon and egg burgers made by Andy at the Chillagoe General Store and catching up. We had planned to meet and cycle up north together, but I couldn't wait for them, and arrived about when they set off from Charleville. Was hoping to still meet up with them and had emailed, but not heard back. Not surprising as reception being iffy out that way.</p>
<p>Before finally getting to the reason for the trip; a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campdrafting">

</a>
near
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimbulah,_Queensland">

</a></p>
<p>Separate out the cow from the pack and keep it up near the gate.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20150726_150335.jpg" >
<img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20150726_150335.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Then chase it around the paddock.  Okay. Was a bit more to it than that. The cows conspired to frustrate the novices. The experienced riders made it look easy. Mostly. Sometimes the cow seemed to know that the exit was at the other side of the paddock, and made a beeline straight out the gate.  One didn't want to play at all, and jump clean over the fence.</p>
<p>Lots of cowboy hats and boots, horses and cows. All well sprinkled with fine brown dust.</p>
