<p>The new rotor arrived today. Its actually the 190mm Magura option from Rohloff. As I guessed, it is a bit big for the caliper to bolt onto. Yuba recommending a 180mm for the rear. I think a 185 would be just spot on.</p>
<p>When I ordered the frame, I also I ordered the adapter from Yuba for the rear 180mm disk. Looking at it now, its way too small. The brakes arrived with two different size adapters - 1 small  (that almost matches the Yuba one),  and one larger - that works better on the rear. Better, but not perfect.</p>
<p>The image above has the caliper resting down onto the top of the rotor. This is with the axle adapters on the Rohloff hub, in the 14mm dropouts. At both ends its about 5mm to bolt flat to the adapter. (Its easier to see the gap on the front bolt.) This will sort its self out tomorrow when the dropouts get narrowed. I'll get some more metal at the bottom of each dropout - and the rotor will drop downward. I might also put some spacers between the adapter, and the caliper to fine tune the height - to get it just right.</p>
<p>I'm excited now - this is all stuff that can be done by me - so there is not more waiting for parts to arrive. Baring any unexpected developments, I should be able to have a ride tomorrow.</p>

<p>You are close!  I had a similar experience with Hayes hydraulics on a Kona Mtb- acutally found some thick aluminum washers to shim the calipers up so my pads were contacting the disc perfectly.  As you say, your dropouts rework gives you latitude to adjust this.  J.</p>

<p>Yes it looks like your close to getting rear disc brakes on a Yuba (one of a very small elite group in the world I think!). Loving the blog (more pics please!) and great to see another Mundo builder in Australia. You seem to have the new style of rear disc mount (on my V3 the 2 holes are parallel to the frame) which is no doubt making the process easier.</p>

<p>I liked your blog also - read that lots to try and work out what disks you had tried.</p>

<p>Finally the trip to the postoffice, saw me return with a large box. First thing was to fit the rear - as it was probably the one that was going to be the problem. Arrrg...It still is a problem :( The 160mm Rohloff rotor is too small (Well that or the disk mount is too high.) I had suspected that before, but was assured that it would all be fine.</p>
<p>Changing the adapter when I realised that I had two different sized ones, helped slightly, but not enough. Still too little disk rotor is under the pads. And still too much for me to "fix" by changes to the dropouts. Not happy. I could have ordered a larger rotor earlier, and not be sitting now waiting again.</p>

<p><em>sighs</em> more waiting time. Need to order a larger rotor. Rohloff don't do a 180mm or 185mm any more, so its either 190mm or 203mm. Yuba recommended a 180mm Rotor, so I'm going to go with the 190mm.</p>
<p>So, more daily trips to the post office waiting for a larger rotor.</p>
<p>The front fits without any dramas. So I've one brake. Might fit up the chain and have bit of a ride about on the weekend.</p>

                <p>The new axle plate makes mounting the wheel a lot easier.  Will wait until I sort out the disk before making the dropouts 10mm. When I narrow the dropouts, I'll add a bit more metal for the torque plate to press against.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Not sure if the 160mm rotor will work. The amount of rotor that is available at the disk mount looks a bit short.</p>
<p>Could get a few millimeters more by making the dropout deeper, but not to much more, else the axle nuts will hit the tube.</p>
<p>I'm not the first to have hassles with the rear disk mount.  I'm hoping that it will not take me too long to sort out.</p>

<p>I'd love to have an internal gear hub on my Mundo, but the ones in my price range aren't rated for any serious loads.  its a shame because I love the gear hubs on my other bikes, even if they are just 3 speeds.  Did you consider the Nuvinci CVP hub before deciding on the Rohloff?  I think I may one day put one of those on mine, partly because they are cheaper and partly because the idea of continuously variable transmission intrigues me (plus it has been done before on the Long Walk To Green blog and held up to heavy loads well).</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck with your build, and once you take it out for a spin I think you will enjoy the ride.</p>

<p>Didn't think about any other hub. I had the Rohloff already. I've used Rohloff hubs in load bikes before. Friends have also. Never had a problem. Some of the bikes had way more load, and way stronger riders powering them, than I am. So the hub is built to last.</p>

<p>Hi Megan.  Good blog.  Makes me want to ride more......</p>
<p>I too have a V3- its awesome- Likely a good choice for being tough when you aren't consumed with weight.</p>
<p>Mine is pretty bare bones, however, external gears and vee brakes.  I have custom fitted aluminium checkplate to the rear rack and sideloaders, added Sweetskinz tires, Electra chrome plated fenders, and a Rolling  Jackass centrestand.  Maybe discs later this year.....</p>
<p>Once I get a front rack on my V3 I will post some pics somewhere. Will be following your Rohloff build. Cheers from Canada's west coast. John</p>

<p>My hopes of being quickly mobile failed.
The Monkeys <sup><a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> for http://www.cheekytransport.com.au</sup>
to the rescue. Called and spoke with Nic. They'll make up the hoses to length, bleed em, and have it all in the post next week.Love those guys!
<a href="http://www.rohloff.com.au/">Rohloff Australia</a>
are sending a new axle plate and disk rotor. With luck enough gear will arrive next week to let me pedal around the cane paddocks. Until then, having to content myself with sitting on the seat, and dreaming of the road ahead.</p>

                <p>Due to a one thing and another, and Ben and I exchanging emails all of last week, and my frame didn't leave the shop until Friday 21st May. Fedex estimated a delivery date of 31st. I was hopeful, but thought it might take longer, but checked their tracking site almost hourly :)</p>
<p>This morning it surprised me. While I was thinking it was just leaving Sydney, it arrived. How is that possible - from USA to the middle of no where so quick. Four days!!! I order stuff in Australia, and it takes longer than that. Needless to say, I'm very happy right now.</p>
<p>I wasted no time unpacking and starting assembly. Thanks heaps Ben. It was well wrapped and padded in the box. It was so exciting unwrapping each item and finding what was there. I can't say enough good things about Ben at Yuba.</p>
<p>See below for all unpacking images.</p>
<p>Finally it was unwrapped and on the floor. Initial impression - its solid. Just what I ordered. I'm happy with the  finish - it is what it is. A good value, cargo bike frame. For the record, there were no scratches on the paint before I started. But as this is going to get a work out touring, I'll be buying some touch up paint at some point. I also assembled with the help of grease. My reasoning is this is a metal frame, its going to spend pretty much all its life outside, a bit of grease on parts will help slow any rust down. The insides of the frame will also get a squirt of something oily also.</p>
<p>First order was getting wide loaders on. Then start to transfer other components from my MTB to it. Wide loaders just went on without any problems. Just slide on and tighten up the bolts.</p>
<p>Then things got interesting. Some things I thought would be a problem, weren't. Others that I thought would be no problem at all - are.</p>
<p>For the problems - at the moment two standing out:</p>
<p>I had planned on using my existing front hydraulic brake, and was leaning towards just using v-brakes on the back to get rolling. But the front hose hose is too short, and its going to need a ton of spacers and longer bolts to fit the caliper. That blew the option of getting it ridable. Time to either get a new front brake, or find spacers and a longer hose. Thinking about it now, I was probably overly optimistic thinking I could use my existing front brake - it was for a very special fork setup, and I did want to raise the handle bars on that bike anyway - so of course the brake hose would be too short!</p>
<p>Next was the Rohloff.  I ordered the axle adapters as the Mundo dropouts are 14mm and the Rohloff axles are 10mm. After taking a drill to the adapters, they fit the axle.</p>
<p>Time to drop the wheel in. I had thought that I'd just drop the wheel in, make an clamp to hold the torsion arm, and be done. This isn't to be. Using the torsion arm and external gear mech on this frame, it is not going to work. Both parts need to be below the frame and so don't fit together.</p>
<p>The dropouts are 7mm steel plate. Looking from the rear with the wheel out, the left hand dropout is flush with the tubing the forms the frame. The right hand side is mounted about the middle of the tubing. This means that there is only the width of the dropout, before the tube bulges out. On the other side of the tube is the disk mount.</p>
<p>After a lot playing with different angles on the axle plate I have, I think that either the OEM axle plate will just work, or the OEM2 axle plate will work with some help. Not 100% certain just yet. I need to find dimensions for the Rohloff drop outs to see how they compare to what metal is available on the Mundo. The Mundo dropouts are long with lots of thick steel - so the OEM is probably going to be the best bet.</p>
<p>I will be taking a welder to the frame though what ever happens. With lots of putting the back wheel in, and taking it back out again, the axle adapters got annoying real fast. They are small, round, and both want to drop off when your not expecting it, and roll away. The other thing that bugged me about them is that the drop out is 7mm thick, but the axle adapters are 4mm wide. I'd like to get a bit more axle in the dropout.</p>
<p>More installing tomorrow.</p>
