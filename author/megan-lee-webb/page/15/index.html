                <p>Been in and out of Sydney the past couple weeks going away weekends with friends.</p>
<p>The first trip on the Australia Day long weekend, I was challenged to take just my two small panniers - which are really the large Ortlieb panniers. It was hard to trim down to that level.  I'm so used to having everything with me. Had to really think about what to leave behind.</p>
<p>The trip was a bit of a wash out. The plan was to spend two nights out. The campsites would be dry, so needed to carry water.  The camps were up high, not quiet on the top of the ridges, but close.  The first night we just got the tents set up before the storm rolled in.  We were not short of water. Wind, rain and lightning. Some of the strikes were so close. With more storms forecast, and high winds on the way, no one wanted to stay another night. Next day was heading back.</p>
<p>It was lighter pedalling with less gear. But I missed my usual gear. I missed knowing where in my panniers everything was. I found it slightly frustrating having to pack those two small bags so carefully to fit everything in.</p>
<p>Last weekend,  I was back to four panniers. I did leave a few things behind. Still caused me problems. This time the panniers were too empty! But found a solution to this on the last day. Apples! The trees were all fruiting this year. Couldn't go past without sampling them. Would have been criminal to leave them behind, so we filled our panniers. Since I had the largest panniers... When we got back I weight the apples I carried - almost 20kg!</p>
<p>The plan was four nights out. Food was shared with a plan of who brought along what. We made up for the washout the week before. The first day was easy as it was mostly downhill, with water, and a luxurious hot shower at the end. After this it was a lot harder, uphill, dirt roads, and carrying water. There were no more showers. More interesting was the food planning; not enough calories for continual days of six hours hard pedalling. We were good for the first two days, but after that, we were all started suffering. But we did have a good time.</p>
<p>We also ate a lot of apples.</p>

                <p>It would have been better to have skipped Bogan Gate, but least Forbes was downhill. It was drizzling still, so I kept going. Eugowra, then back onto dirt to get to Cudal. Found another road that the GPS offers as a route, but isn't there. It was a pleasant 15km hill climbing detour to sort that out.</p>
<p>Stayed in Orange the one night, then set off to Bathurst early the next morning. Arrived in Bathurst early - sat around reading, eating, sleeping. It had gotten very windy so I wasn't keen on moving, but then at 3pm, the wind dropped a bit, and changed direction. Now it was a tail wind. Hah. Can't sit still for that.</p>
<p>Finished the day with
<a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/Orange+NSW/Lake+Wallace,+Wallerawang,+New+South+Wales/@-33.3667154,148.9995367,9z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b102cd0e28c4861:0x50609b4904423f0!2m2!1d149.1012702!2d-33.2835775!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b0df636db7a9991:0x2a0609b4d1de62e0!2m2!1d150.0794347!2d-33.4160193!3e1">120km</a>
on my legs.  Wasn't an enjoyable road. Lots of traffic, minimal or no shoulder in places. The drivers that pass without much clearance.</p>
<p>I could have gone into Lithgow, but stopped at Lake Wallace,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallerawang">Wallerawang</a>
to check it out.</p>
<p>Big mistake.</p>
<p>I arrived late - just on dark, so rushed to set-up camp. There was a bit of a crowd - back packers, campervans, etc. Not a place I like to stay, but it was late. Wanted to check it out for friends that had asked about staying there. Only one night.</p>
<p>Terrible. Terrible. Not sure which group it was, but they drank, yelled, argued till the early hours of the morning. Young sounding, I suspected the backpackers, but it could have been locals partying. The grounds are close to Lithgow and housing areas.</p>
<p>Lithgow Tourist Information had told me in the past that camping is allowed there. What they didn't say is that the toilets are locked overnight.  I've dealt with this in the past - bottles and bags, carry it out. Not a problem.  Others dealt with it by using the ground.  In the morning there was used toilet paper blowing about, and fresh faeces scattered about. Icky! Icky! Seeing the gardens in the light - this was not a once off affair. The gardeners there must be saving on fertilizer costs. Feeling dirty angry, and disgusted, I packed and left.</p>
<p>I stopped to complain at the Tourist Information Centre. They said that it had nothing to do with them, wasn't their problem, and nothing they could do.  They still direct people to stay there.</p>
<p>Sunday. Trains.  Track work :(</p>
<p>I could change trains five times, and take almost six hours to get to my destination.  Wasn't going to do it. Change at stations without ramps or lifts - lots of carrying bike up and down stairs. Sunday, there would be no staff about. Finding the right platform and train to catch would be an added challenge. I decided to wait till Monday - two trains, three and a half hours.</p>
<p>Caught the 4:16 train out of Lithgow. Not many people on it at that time. But it filled to standing room only as it progressed down the mountain.</p>
<p>So now back in Sydney for a visit before heading north. Will be a here on and off for a few weeks. Friends with holidays wanting to go cycling and camping. So I'll be out of town a bit.</p>

                <p>With lots of looking at the weather, the map and the weather again. I planed a route to Condobolin that would have taken two days. Some of it was to be on dirt roads, but when I arrived at the first one, it didn't look promising; standing water, sticky mud, and signs saying "Dry weather road".</p>
<p>I stayed on the tar and arrived by lunch time.</p>

<p>So, on to the next town. I had to be in Sydney by the weekend, so needed to pedal more. But..</p>
<p>Australia has a few fences. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo_Fence">Dog Fence</a>
, and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit-proof_fence">Rabbit Proof Fence</a>
. Where they cross roads, there is a gate. Australia has a slang term "
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan">Bogan</a>
".  So, when I saw the town
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan_Gate">Bogan Gate</a>
on the map. I had to go there. Sadly it was disappointing. No fence. No Gate. No sign. No Bogans. Nothing. I met other travellers later who were just as disappointed. There is a small town there, but no one about when I stopped. Thought there would be something to cash in on the tourist appeal of the name.  From the Wikipedia entry, the residents in places with the word "Bogan" in their name have lobbied to have a name change. They don't want to be associated with Bogans.</p>
<p>Was nothing to do, but ride on in the showers.</p>

                <p>Claws on cement. I call out, thinking it's a dog. "Get away", "go on". The claws continue. Rolling over and looking in the half light, it's small. Possum I think. Then I wake fully, too low for that. It keeps coming towards me, reaching the tent.  I scramble for the torch. Arrrrrggh!!! Echidna! Now I'm rushing to open the zip, and stop out before it tries to push underneath. I stop it on my door mat. It "digs in" Phew.</p>
<p>Discarding my "no intervention" ideal, I move it, on the mat, around my tent, onto the grass, and go back to bed. Saved!</p>

                <p>An underappreciated pleasure: warm dry clothing. It's a cool day and I'd just washed myself and cloths, when the showers start. Not wanting to get another set wet, I squeeze as much water out as I can, then put them back on. They'll dry faster with a heater in them, even if the heater doesn't enjoy the sensation.</p>
<p>Quiet day after that, listening to the rain on the zinc roof under a picnic shelter.</p>
<p>It showers, drizzles or rains during the night. When I wake, it continues. I fail to leave.</p>
<p>I find out the locals have all been talking about the poor woman in her tent at the picnic shelter. When the fourth person comes over to offer somewhere out of the wind and rain, I give in. More to ease their worries than from concern about the wind and rain. I move to another larger shelter, out of sight. It's also more peaceful, people wise. Empty sheds nearby, roofing iron clangs in the wind makes a memorable night.</p>
