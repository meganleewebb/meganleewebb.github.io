                <p>Well, time to farewell Sydney again and head north. First stop for the day is my old favourite: Broke</p>

<p>A bit or history for the place. Its certainly a lot smaller now.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Found the above information board near the new bridge Looking at the water flowing underneath, I dare say it was probably a lot deeper back in those days. At the moment it looks like you could hop across without wetting your feet.  The bridge is high off the water, so the floods would be a sight to see.</p>
<p>I left Sydney after the morning peak hours rush was over and this time it was a lot less busy getting out. The trip still took me four and a half hours driving time. Yeah, I wasn't rushing at all. Stopped several times for a break.  Just cruised along gently along the Putty Road. I thought it was very scenic.  Day dreamed about cycling along it.. I still having bicycle withdrawal symptoms. Still got my bike with me in the van though. And do get out and ride it. But not the same as days touring. Trade offs...</p>
<p>Time is a passing. And this clock says it all:</p>

                <p>The weather in Sydney the last few days has been wonderful. Too good to be inside, I've been out walking the streets, checkout out some of our great buildings like this one:</p>

<p>My trip into Sydney was delayed a bit by the record temperatures forecast. I was still up near Armidale at that time and decided to stick around up in the mountains and not experience 46C temperatures.</p>
<p>First item of business was to get the van serviced. I mentioned to the guy that recommended Bears Auto Clinic for getting my windscreen fixed that they did a terrible job. (<a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2013/01/2013-01-10-a-real-shoddy-job-by/">See here</a> for the full story.) He immediately called up Bears and spoke to them, then told me to go around and talk with them. So I did. I didn't expect much from this. As I complained when I picked the van up about only fixing part of the windscreen and not all of it. Was told then that it would have cost more to fix all the window, even though the quote has "Rust around front screen" on it. Not: rust on bottom of windscreen. So, went around and spoke with Michael (again) at Bears. He was all sorry that I'd had a bad experience, blamed everyone else: the window installers (leaking windows), and the paint suppliers (rust started within a month of the paint inside the van), and promised to call me back after speaking to them. That was last Thursday morning.  Lets say I'm still waiting for his call.</p>

                <p>Sat out the Xmass and New Years period in a bush camp up near Tenterfield. Was a quiet time for me. The first week was mostly showers, which meant it was cool. It fined up and heated up in the second week, but still night time temps were under 20C. Something nice about snuggling into the sleeping bag in cold weather.</p>
<p>The fine weather gave me time to wire up a second battery in the van and try it out. The technical stuff: I've a

charger, an Exide 105 ah AGM battery, and a Sharp 130W folding solar panel. Still new, but it certainly keeps my phone charged.</p>
<p>Found this bug wandering about the grass up near Tenterfield.   Wasn't hard to miss with its bright colors.</p>

                <p>I wrote this post over Xmass, but have held off posting it because I don't like saying how bad people are. I much prefer to say how great that are and give compliments. But thinking of the "work" that Bears, I find myself getting angry.</p>
<p>I had Bears Auto Hospital of Woolongong do some work on my van. I cringe to use "work" here as I was ripped off; Really I paid for them for a shoddy job.</p>
<p>Initially when I picked up the van, it was filthy - dust and grit throughout, over the dash, seats and in the rear. They said they run out of time to do any cleaning. On complaining about this, they did offer a free detailing if I'd bring it back to them another day. I was leaving the area, and by this time had seen the windscreen work so, I decided that I wouldn't take them up on that offer.</p>
<p>At the same time I went back to complain about the dust and grit, I also asked about a small spot of rust in the cargo bay that they said they would fix at the same time as the windscreen. They offered to do it straight away. Arrrrgghhh - their fix was paint over the top of it, without removing the rust that was there!!! This should have clued me up that their other work might not have been the best, but, I left looking at the repairs until now (mid December), and 1000km away.</p>
<p>I started cleaning it up now. First up was the outside wash; But, I found water dripping in the drivers side under the dash.. oh o... Pulled all the vinyl matting out - it was all damp -  and put the hose on to run water down the windscreen. Yep, water is leaking in on both the drivers and the passenger side.</p>
<p>On top of feeling angry and frustrated, that Bears Auto Hospital removed the windscreen to fix the rust around it and only fixed one corner of the rust, I now have a leaking windscreen!</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/noglue.jpg" >

</a></p>
<p>Went to windscreen repair place in Byron, and they said that there wasn't much sealer around the windscreen.. They tried to patch it up, but said that it probably wouldn't work and that the windscreen would have to be removed and refitted. Didn't charge me for trying though.  They were right, the patch didn't work, it still leaks.</p>
<p>The Bears Auto Hospital quote does say "Rust <strong> around </strong> front screen".</p>
<p>Here is around the windscreen. This is the stuff I was paying to get fixed:</p>

</a></p>
<p>While the van was in getting the windscreen done, I asked for and got a quote to paint the van floor. Seemed a good idea at the time.</p>
<p>Bears didn't remove the rubber grommets before painting, just painted over the top of them. I think they pulled some grommets out, or more likely they were sand blasted away, as this one shows, the ones remaining were painted over. I had pulled some out myself, I'm not 100% sure if the missing grommets are a result of Bears or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/grommet.jpg" >
<img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/grommet.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>But this was nothing compared to what I found when I went to change the back door seal. Under the weather strip and rubber seal, where you can't see it:</p>
<p><a href="{static}/images/2013/1-IMG_0671. >
<img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/1-IMG_0671.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Less than two months and its rusting. Bears removed the strip and seal, painted, and put it all back.</p>
<p>Not one item of the job I had done by Bears Auto Hospital, Woolongong, was done well. The easy to see parts of the job looked okay, until they were more closely examined.</p>
<p>Okay, Bears has many workers - maybe I was just unlucky to get one that wasn't so switched on that week. However, when I confronted the manager, I could have had a better response than I did. My experience with the work, and dealings with Bears Auto Hospital just leaves me really angry.</p>
<p>I <strong>do not recommend</strong> Bears Auto Hospital to anyone.</p>
<p>The happy ending to this sad tail was that I went to
<a href="http://www.simmonsbyronbay.com.au/pages/byron-bay-panel-beating/">
Warren Simmons Panel Beating
</a>
in Byon Bay and he fixed the windscreen and the paint issues. Warren did a excellent job - all the rust sanded away and painted. The windscreen does not leak.  The job was booked in, and the work completed in three days. After the my negative experience with Bears Auto Hospital, dealing with Warren Simmons Panel Beating was wonderful.</p>
