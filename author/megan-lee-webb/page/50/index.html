<p>I used to think mirrors were not needed on bicycles. Shamefully, I used to heap scorn on anyone who suggested using a mirror. Why would you want a mirror when you can turn your head and see behind you?</p>
<p>As so often is the case, after trying a mirror, I now wouldn't be without one.</p>
<p>The mirror lets you see at a glance if there is anything coming behind. It doesn't replace turning your head and looking behind, but it sure does help let you know what is happening behind at times when you can't turn your head.</p>
<p>Sure you can often hear there is a car or truck coming. But not always. Depending on the wind, you get no warning at all. Also, while you might hear the first car or truck, if there are several,  you will not be able to tell if there is one or more from the sound.  As the first is going past, and your concentrating on avoiding potholes, or rough edges, a quick glance in the mirror lets  you know how many more.</p>
<p>I use a handle bar mirror, rather than a helmet mounted one, cause I didn't like the way the helmet mounted mirrors create a blind spot. But other people swear that helmet ones are best.  What ever works for you - try them both.  Get a mirror and discover how useful it is in leting you know what is going on behind.</p>

<p>Was talking with a future cycle tourer this morning, and we were going through bike bits. Whats good and what isn't.  He was tossing up what light weigh folding tire  to take as a spare for his year long trip. Luckily he had  already found the best brand:  Schwalbe.</p>
<p>Schwalbe are the only tires I use. I came across them originally by chance, but now don't use anything else. Why? Simple. No flats. Well maybe not no flats ever, but darn close to that. Before Schwalbe tires, I was fast at fixing punctures. The quick stop, get tools, tire lever off the bit of tire where the puncture was, pull out the tube a bit, file tire, glue, press out the thorn/glass/nail from tire, patch on glue, press, push tire in tube, tire on rim, pump, tools back in the bag, wipe hands and cycle on.  I was fast from lots of practice with cheap tires.</p>
<p>One day, after a bad run of flats, I asked my local bike shop if there were any better tires for punctures. Result was Schwalbe tires.  That was years ago when I was still riding to work.  I still fixed flats - on other peoples bikes. But commuting, I didn't have another puncture. And there were times when I rode over so much glass, that I was cringing just  waiting for the tire to deflate. It never did.</p>
<p>Now touring,  I've managed to puncture a couple of times. I like riding on dirt roads, and camping in the bush. Often I'll ride off the road, across the drain and into a paddock. Sometimes the tires are furry with thorns and prickles.  Maybe this got me once. Don't know.  I  had one puncture that I don't know the cause of late last year. I suspect barbed wire.  My other puncture was from running over a tent peg on the road.  It rattled around in the spokes and frame, and then jamed into the tire. Granted the tire was worn, and maybe should have been changed hundreds of km sooner, I don't think anything would have stood up to that tent peg.</p>
<p>Currently with over 7000km touring I'm very happy to be running Schwalbe tires. I like to spend my time riding,  not fixing flats.</p>
<p>And the light weight spare folding tire? What I do is just take another full tire. There isn't much weight savings on a folding tire. The folding tire isn't going to be the same as what your using each day. Even if you just use it to "get you to the nearest town" - the next town may not have the tire you want (or any tires!). So just carry a spare of what tire you use. And  of course, use  Schwalbe tires</p>

<p>The new love of my life. Lusted after a Surly 1x1 for years, but the new Troll is a way better watch for me.</p>
<p>Picked her up yesterday afternoon. Twas a late night after that.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting the pic!  I'm putting together a Troll build very similar to yours.  Would you mind giving details of your build?  I'm especially interested in your drive train choices and your fender and tire width.  I want to use a Tubus Cosmo rack, but I'm not sure if it will fit with my Big Apple 2.35" tires and SKS 65mm fenders. Thanks, Scott</p>

<p>Nice setup.  I'm curious, did you get the 16" or 18" frame?</p>

<p>G'day Megan</p>
<p>Graham at Ridgways Cycles put me onto your blog. I'm going to follow it.</p>
<p>I did a ride on Route 66 in 2012 on a Surly Troll  I bought it in Chicago. If you want a read, the blog I wrote about the trip can be reached here http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/rootedon66.</p>
<p>The Troll is only the second new bike I've ever owned (the first was a Malvern Star tourer given to me in 1979) I still own both. I'm contemplating doing another long bike trip, but not sure when or where.</p>
<p>Happy trails</p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>Thanks for the link. I've since read about your trip. Amazing. Love the old photos you have. You put a lot of work into your trip journal.</p>
<p>Keep on cycling</p>

                <p>I'm not carrying a laptop or netbook - not because I don't want one; just waiting for technology to catch up. I want a screen that is readable in the sunlight, better battery life and low power usage - then it can be charged either from the hub or solar.</p>
<p>At present I'm using a Nokia 5800 as my main gadget. It works doing: gps, maps(on and off line), camera, web browser, email client,  ebook reader, mp3 player, radio, note taker,sms and lastly lets not forget, for phone calls.</p>
<p>So any photos are taken from the phone. Blog posts when not a PC are emailed though. Bit limited for the formating options, but one day I'll get a better phone, until then this is good enough.</p>

<p>To power this, I'm using a small solar panel  It is book sized, and  has two 6v 400mA panels that can be used individually, or joined for 12V  400mA. Love this. While there's sun, I've power. One day I will work at  connecting the Schmitt hub up to a battery pack to gather more energy  while riding. But for now, the sun is working fine for me.</p>
<p>I used to only put it out in the sun when I was stopped. Recently I've been ocky strapping it on top of the panniers. By keeping the phone in the pannier and rolling the top of the pannier losely, it keeps the phone out of the dust.</p>
<p>I can also play music from the phone while its inside the panner. Was doing this with the music on the phone speaker, but could use ear phones if I wanted.  I don't bother playing music when riding. Only used it when walking when most of the day was pushing up hill. Singing along seemed to make the hills shorter.</p>

<p>When I was in Brisbane, I purchased this small folding blue tooth keyboard. Its wonderful. Really love being able to type normally. If you look back on my posts, before Brisbane, they tended to be very short. With this little baby, I can type longer posts. Great for emailing friends or taking notes. Takes one AAA battery, and so far its still on the same one. Smart circuits to shut things down when its not being used.</p>

<p>I do have a battery pack (2000mAH USB connectors for charging from solar panel) than can charge the phone. But so far I haven't used it. I might not continue to carry this. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but practically, I use the phone most when its sunny, and when its raining, I don't get it out to avoid getting it wet.</p>

                <p>Exped Auriga Tent  3100gm</p>
<p>Exped Auriga tent footprint 350gm</p>
<p>Cheap Poly Blue 6x8 tarp 220gm</p>
<p>Cheap Poly Green 6x8 tarp 340gm</p>
<p>The  blue tarp goes on the ground, then the footprint is placed on top of  that. The tent sits on the footprint. Some of my tent sites have lots of  sharp stones. The blue tarp is getting very thin now and has many  holes. I'll replace it soon. The footprint also has holes. So far the tent bottom is not holed yet, but does have some thinner spots.</p>
<p>Soon after starting to use the tent I emailed Exped asking about UV resistance. The instructs say to "avoid prologed UV exposure". What is prolonged?.</p>
<p>Their reply was very fast: "When daily exposed to the sun the fly will have a live span of around half a year. The fabric than will be UV-damaged, easy to rip and dull color. To expand the span of life of your tent, pitch it up in a shady place take away the fly or cover the tent with a UV-proof foil, like a first aid sheet." I've followed this - covering the tent, moving it about in the shade, or even taking it down if staying somewhere for the day.</p>
<p>The tent has a 5 year warranty, and I had one claim on it leaking. Exped couldn't find where it was leaking, but seam sealed it again. They also said they were happy to look at the issue again if it leaked, and asked that I mark the leaking points. They also noted that they had not had problems before with leaking. I only found good reviews online.</p>
<p>A couple of months later it did leak again. I elected not to claim again, as I'd be without a tent for the time to send it to Sydney, get it tested, and returned. So I bought some seam sealer and covered the seams again. I also started using the green tarp to cover the top of the tent when it rains. Not sure if it is the seam sealer or the tarp on top, but I haven't had it leak since. And it has been in some very heavy rain.</p>
<p>I used to be very sore on this tent considering the money I paid for it. But now after looking at other tents and having used it lots of different locations and circumstances, I'm feeling very friendly towards it. I appreciate more now the features and quality in the tent.</p>
<p>If you think my tent is "heavy" like I was initially. Consider this: the lighter weight tents are lighter because of thinner fabric. Thinner fabric isn't going to last as long, and is more prone to damage.</p>
<p>One thing I don't like about this tent is the bag. You pack it in from the top like a shopping bag. There is no real closing for this - just a string across middle of the opening.</p>
<p>At the moment, I'm giving it a UV treatment and going to add patches to the thinner spots on the floor.</p>
