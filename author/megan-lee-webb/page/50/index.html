<p>Was heading back to where I'm staying, via some of the dumpsters I've visited in the past. Being away, places have shut down and of course new places have opened. Its not the best area, but sometimes you get lucky. Today was one of those days.</p>
<p>Ended up with  9 loaves of bread, and some buns. Cause I wasn't going to eat that much so spent most of the afternoon finding people to give bread to.  Was looking for people begging, or in need. Some beggers didn't want food, only money.  Gave away all that I didn't want  in the end.</p>
<p>Wasn't actually looking for food though. Was looking for some stainless steel to make a bracket for my front rack. I'm going to mount a rear Tubus Cosmo rack on the front.  My plan needs a small U shaped bracket. I want this to be stainless steel.  Didn't find any this time. I did pick up a handful of milling and lathe bits from one skip outside a house in the suburbs. Going to find someone to give them to tomorrow.</p>
<p>Also gathered up some clothes and dropped them in to one of the church charity bins.</p>
<p>Feeling happy with the day. Nothing like digging around in bins, and giving stuff away.</p>

<p>Tooth is still sore. Specialist thinks it might get better, or might not. But to come back in another month, unless it heals or hurts more. Arrrgggh... $220 for "extended consultation" (maybe 15 minutes all up), x-ray, and "Pulp vitality test" (Bite down on this - does that hurt?)</p>
<p>If it gets worse, it root canal treatment - that will be about $2000. Ouch. It it stops hurting, then all would be good for a while. Needless to say, I'm keen on it settling down.</p>
<p>Front wheel bearings in the Schmitt hub are gone. Was trying to think how many km they have done, but apart from the 7000 odd touring, they did service for a couple of years before that, when I didn't have a bike computer.  To get them changed is going to take a week. A place down Melbourne does them. Luckily for me, I was loaned a spare front wheel that I can use to ride about on in the mean time. So getting the bearings changed now.</p>
<p>Dropped the bike computer and broke the button off. I can still change it with a small twig, and found the button. Going to try and glue it up,</p>
<p>What else can fail/break?</p>
<p>Been doing some more tidying up on the Troll. Yesterdays effort was a small guard to stop my heel swipping off the caliper bleed cover.  Next time I need  a new caliper, I'll look at where the bleeder exits. Not something you think of normally.</p>

                <p>My planed date to leave Sydney is up in the air again. Saturday morning a tooth started aching. By Sunday it was clear that it wasn't going to get better on its own. Luckily yesterday I was able to see a dentist. Unfortunately, its not clear which of two teeth is the problem. One hurts on pressing, the other doesn't respond to hot/cold feelings.</p>
<p>More pain and off to see a specialist today.</p>
<p>Is there a bright side to this? Maybe. Its probably better to have this happen in Sydney than out in the country where the dental services are fewer and further apart.</p>

<p>I used to think mirrors were not needed on bicycles. Shamefully, I used to heap scorn on anyone who suggested using a mirror. Why would you want a mirror when you can turn your head and see behind you?</p>
<p>As so often is the case, after trying a mirror, I now wouldn't be without one.</p>
<p>The mirror lets you see at a glance if there is anything coming behind. It doesn't replace turning your head and looking behind, but it sure does help let you know what is happening behind at times when you can't turn your head.</p>
<p>Sure you can often hear there is a car or truck coming. But not always. Depending on the wind, you get no warning at all. Also, while you might hear the first car or truck, if there are several,  you will not be able to tell if there is one or more from the sound.  As the first is going past, and your concentrating on avoiding potholes, or rough edges, a quick glance in the mirror lets  you know how many more.</p>
<p>I use a handle bar mirror, rather than a helmet mounted one, cause I didn't like the way the helmet mounted mirrors create a blind spot. But other people swear that helmet ones are best.  What ever works for you - try them both.  Get a mirror and discover how useful it is in leting you know what is going on behind.</p>

<p>Was talking with a future cycle tourer this morning, and we were going through bike bits. Whats good and what isn't.  He was tossing up what light weigh folding tire  to take as a spare for his year long trip. Luckily he had  already found the best brand:  Schwalbe.</p>
<p>Schwalbe are the only tires I use. I came across them originally by chance, but now don't use anything else. Why? Simple. No flats. Well maybe not no flats ever, but darn close to that. Before Schwalbe tires, I was fast at fixing punctures. The quick stop, get tools, tire lever off the bit of tire where the puncture was, pull out the tube a bit, file tire, glue, press out the thorn/glass/nail from tire, patch on glue, press, push tire in tube, tire on rim, pump, tools back in the bag, wipe hands and cycle on.  I was fast from lots of practice with cheap tires.</p>
<p>One day, after a bad run of flats, I asked my local bike shop if there were any better tires for punctures. Result was Schwalbe tires.  That was years ago when I was still riding to work.  I still fixed flats - on other peoples bikes. But commuting, I didn't have another puncture. And there were times when I rode over so much glass, that I was cringing just  waiting for the tire to deflate. It never did.</p>
<p>Now touring,  I've managed to puncture a couple of times. I like riding on dirt roads, and camping in the bush. Often I'll ride off the road, across the drain and into a paddock. Sometimes the tires are furry with thorns and prickles.  Maybe this got me once. Don't know.  I  had one puncture that I don't know the cause of late last year. I suspect barbed wire.  My other puncture was from running over a tent peg on the road.  It rattled around in the spokes and frame, and then jamed into the tire. Granted the tire was worn, and maybe should have been changed hundreds of km sooner, I don't think anything would have stood up to that tent peg.</p>
<p>Currently with over 7000km touring I'm very happy to be running Schwalbe tires. I like to spend my time riding,  not fixing flats.</p>
<p>And the light weight spare folding tire? What I do is just take another full tire. There isn't much weight savings on a folding tire. The folding tire isn't going to be the same as what your using each day. Even if you just use it to "get you to the nearest town" - the next town may not have the tire you want (or any tires!). So just carry a spare of what tire you use. And  of course, use  Schwalbe tires</p>
