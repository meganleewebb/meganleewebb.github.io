                <p>I'd left Julia Creek for Kynuna. It was a cold morning, and I had delayed starting. Only 117km, no worries. Until the wind blew up, the temperature soared, and I flagged. Then to top it all off, in the hottest part of the day, the rear tire went flat!  What? A new tire, it doesn't puncture! It hadn't. The tube had a patch and it had separated. Darn. Patched it again without taking the wheel off, loaded up, pffffttt. The new patch didn't stick. At this point I took the wheel off and replaced the tube with a patch free one. All this in the blazing sun, flies and dust. Not sure if the glue was off or it was just too hot.</p>
<p>With a new tube of glue, in the cooler evening I patched the tube again to keep for a spare.</p>
<p>Over the next rise, and I met a lovely couple with a camper trailer having a break on the side of the road. They topped me up with water, so I could skip riding into Kynuna, and head straight to Winton. A 10km saving.</p>
<p>Ended up camped near the road, behind a bush about 100km from Julia Creek.</p>
<p>I'm sure no one could see me here :-)</p>

                <p>Another blusterious day. Lucky it's a rest day for me. Though, it's not as hot as yesterday, or will be tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sheltering with a magpie. It's been singing non stop; probably complaining about the wind. Or, maybe that I'm not providing any food. I've enough of my own problems there. The spare tire around my waist has migrated downwards. As the legs have grown, the appetite has soared. Stocked up yesterday for today, and promptly ate it all this morning for breakfast. Another shop is needed if I'm not to eat the cycling rations. Better do that while there is a shop. Next one will be in Winton, three long days pedal away. And more headwinds and heat is forecast.</p>

                <p>Found that with the high winds, I didn't want to try lighting up the stove. Sitting in a sea of dry grass, windy, lighting a fire - no way. But needed to use my pasta up, as I didn't have enough non cook items to get me to the next town.</p>
<p>Soak it!</p>
<p>Yep, it worked. Soaked overnight, it was edible in the morning.  If I waited until evening, it started fermenting though. Still edible - just a bit fizzy.</p>
<p>Add milk powder, or curry and yum.</p>
<p>The water is sweet, the pasta a bit tasteless..  That is what the milk powder or curry is for.</p>
<p>Found the same with my breakfast - rolled oats, desiccated coconut and dried dates.  Best to eat it before lunch.  By the evening, its fermenting. Again still edible, just a bit fizzy.</p>
<p>I use peanut butter jar to soak food in. When the food starts fermenting, the containers swell - so could leak. Make sure they are standing upright in the panniers..</p>

                <p>Didn't stop in Cloncurry, known as Curry to the locals.  After four days of not very many people, it seemed crowded at the Foodworks on a Sunday. Decided to head to Julia Creek. Give me a bit more time to think about which way I'm going.</p>
<p>This might be sounding monotonous, but it was steady days of cycling at 15km/hr into the wind. Yep, its windy and all directions I want to go, are into it. The land around here is big open flat planes. Nothing to hide behind, nothing to stop the wind.</p>
<p>Ended up camped near a creek, that had a bit of water in a few holes. Watched all the birds come for a drink. With 33C temps, and windy, its hot.</p>
<p>Stopped in Julia Creek now, as the forecast has 7km winds. But the observation is 32km/hr with gusts up 43km/hr.</p>

<p>Its dry here. Hasn't rained in three years. The locals are hoping for some rain this year. Cause, when that happens, it will be a flood.</p>

                <p>I left Normanton about 4am. Just couldn't sleep. Went to bed early, not feeling the best. Then kept waking all night. So at 3am, decided to do something about all the cool, still weather. Packed up and I was off.</p>
<p>When the sun peeked over the horizon, I saw that I was on a sea of golden brown grass. With the increased light, increased wind. Sailing I was. Not the skip across the wave tops type, nor the lazing about on deck with a glass of something alcoholic. This was the labouring into the wind type of sailing.</p>

</a></p>
<p>I'd managed 50km by sun up. Three hours - not bad. The next 50 took 5 hours. A much slower pace.  I had two car drivers stop. One gentleman, whose name escapes me now, picked me up with tea and lamingtons. A real life saver. I'd been feeling not the best still. But after this, I was almost back to normal.</p>
<p>The next driver to stop was Jim of Free Scotland. His gift was stuff from heaven; cashews, peanuts and dried banana chips. Thanks Jim - they lasted two days.</p>
<p>I'd called it quits for the day not long after waving off Jim. Too hot. Found a solitary bush to shelter behind.</p>
<p>Next day, was a repeat; without the early rising, or the drivers stopping. A steady day of 15km/hr into the wind was itinerary. Seven hours to the Burke and Wills Roadhouse for a couple of burgers. Avoid being trampled at the counter by large mammalian creatures, then on another hour to find a campsite away from the crowds.</p>
<p>No surprise the next day was a repeat. Steady day of pedalling into head winds. I tried a few times if walking was faster; no. I also tried tacking across the road. Seemed to help, but then it didn't.  Just keep pedalling..</p>

<p>Stopped at a pub outside of Cloncurry, but it was too early. Just had to keep going...</p>
