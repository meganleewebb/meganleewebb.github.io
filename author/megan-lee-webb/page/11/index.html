<p>Not caught up on all my posts yet.  And I'm getting ready to shoot through.  Just been just off playing tourist for a bit in the past week.</p>

<p>Headed out west. Stopped to watching the <a href="http://www.savannahlander.com.au/">Savannahlander</a> pulling in at
<a href="http://www.mbahistsoc.org.au/locations/location-almaden.html">Almaden</a>, the end of the line.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Then onto <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillagoe,_Queensland">Chillagoe</a> for a walk about the rocks and ruins.  And a surprise catch up with
<a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-03-uluru-ayers-rock/">
Stuart and Thomas
</a>
of baking fame back in 2012 on the Great Central Road. They were travelling with Robet. Bit of a shock for Thomas, yacking away in the beer garden of the pub, talking all about me when I walked in, sat down and heckled him.</p>
<p>Not surprising he didn't recognise me out of my cycle gear. He'd only ever seen me like
<a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-19-my-first-damper/" >this</a>.  Impossible to know if I had hair, let alone style and colour.</p>
<p>Stayed an extra day, eating delicious bacon and egg burgers made by Andy at the Chillagoe General Store and catching up. We had planned to meet and cycle up north together, but I couldn't wait for them, and arrived about when they set off from Charleville. Was hoping to still meet up with them and had emailed, but not heard back. Not surprising as reception being iffy out that way.</p>
<p>Before finally getting to the reason for the trip; a

near
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimbulah,_Queensland">

<p>Separate out the cow from the pack and keep it up near the gate.</p>

<img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20150726_150335.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Then chase it around the paddock.  Okay. Was a bit more to it than that. The cows conspired to frustrate the novices. The experienced riders made it look easy. Mostly. Sometimes the cow seemed to know that the exit was at the other side of the paddock, and made a beeline straight out the gate.  One didn't want to play at all, and jump clean over the fence.</p>
<p>Lots of cowboy hats and boots, horses and cows. All well sprinkled with fine brown dust.</p>

                <p>When seeing the dunny in the previous post, I couldn't help but remember this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_poet">bush poem</a>
:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Poor Old Grandad!</strong></p>
<p>Poor old Granddad's passed away, cut off in his prime,<br>
He never had a day off crook - gone before his time,<br>
We found him in the dunny, collapsed there on the seat,<br>
A startled look upon his face, his trousers around his feet,<br>
The doctor said his heart was good - fit as any trout,<br>
The Constable he had his say, 'foul play' was not ruled out.<br>
There were theories at the inquest of snakebite without trace,<br>
Of redbacks quietly creeping and death from outer space,<br>
No-one had a clue at all - the judge was in some doubt,<br>
When Dad was called to have his say as to how it came about,<br>
'I reckon I can clear it up,' said Dad with trembling breath,<br>
'You see it's quite a story - but it could explain his death.'<br>
'This here exploration mob had been looking at our soil,<br>
And they reckoned that our farm was just the place for oil,<br>
So they came and put a bore down and said they'd make some trials,<br>
They drilled a hole as deep as hell, they said about three miles.<br>
Well, they never found a trace of oil and off they went, post haste,<br>
And I couldn't see a hole like that go to flamin' waste,<br>
So I moved the dunny over it - real smart move I thought,<br>
I'd never have to dig again - I'd never be 'caught short'.<br>
The day I moved the dunny, it looked a proper sight,<br>
But I didn't dream poor Granddad would pass away that night,<br>
Now I reckon what has happened - poor Granddad didn't know,<br>
The dunny was re-located when that night he had to go.<br>
And you'll probably be wondering how poor Granddad did his dash--<br>
Well, he always used to hold his breath<br>
Until he heard the splash!!<br></p>

                <p>While in Meandarra, thanks to my mate
<a href="#1" name="top1">
<sup>

</a>
, I rekindled an interest in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football">Aussie Rules</a>
<a href="#2" name="top2">
<sup>

</a>
. I'd last watch the 2010 St Kilda vs Collingwood Grand Final when I was in Stonehenge, that ended in a draw. I missed the next game where Collingwood won.  He was trying to get me excited about the upcoming State of Origin game between Queensland and New South Wales. He had Buckley's
<a href="#3" name="top3">
<sup>
3
</sup>
</a>
of that. I've never been interested in the rugby.  Even without knowing the rules, there was something about the players; their lack of necks, the 'sniff each others armpits' gatherings, running forward but throwing the ball backwards! And they always throw themselves at the ground. What is with that?  The players can't think at all; get ball, run straight forward to smack into another player, all fall down. Get up, and repeat. Like blowies
<a href="#4" name="top4">

</a>
at the window, thump, thump, thump, over and over again. The line from
<a href="http://www.australianculture.org/the-man-from-ironbark-paterson/">The Man from Ironbark</a>
always comes to mind: "Their eyes were dull, their heads were flat, they had no brains at all;"</p>
<p>My mate explained, there is Rugby League and Rugby Union. And when looking into the history, it all becomes clear.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union">Rugby Union</a>
started about 1845 at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_School">Ruby School</a>
, the oldest, most expensive boys school in England.  Soccer, also called football, was the game played before that. A game where only the goalkeeper can touch the ball with their hands. What happened was, one of the rich boys, not able to kick the ball, picked it up and ran. Maybe he'd also heard about the new game played out in Australia, but didn't know the rules. He couldn't kick a ball to save himself. Not being too bright, he ran straight into another player, and they all fell over.  His father, who gave big bikkies
<a href="#5" name="top5">
<sup>

</sup>
</a>
to the school, said his son was right, that was the way to play football. The school, not wanting to get in a blue
<a href="#6" name="top6">
<sup>

</sup>
</a>
with the father, and risk losing all the moolah
<a href="#7" name="top7">
<sup>

</sup>
</a>
he gave to the school,  gave into to him and agreed.  After that, everyone was told to play the new game. Thats what happened,  Fair dinkum
<a href="#8" name="top8">
<sup>

</sup>
</a>
!</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league">Rugby League</a>
formed in 1895 when some clubs split from the rest over an argument about players pay.</p>
<p>Where as,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_Australian_rules_football">Aussie Rules</a>
had its beginnings in the early 1820's in Melbourne. With
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club">Melbourne Football club</a>
being the oldest in the world that is now professional.</p>
<p>So would you rather support an English game, created by rich school boys that can't kick a football, or a true blue
<a href="#9" name="top9">
<sup>

</sup>
</a>
Aussie game? No question there; Aussie Rules!!!</p>
<p>As for the State of Origin games; Aussie Rules had been playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_matches_in_Australian_rules_football">interstate competitions</a>
were played from 1879.   Rugby games were played from 1908, but wasn't really known about till a couple of journalists, wanting to sell more papers, got the rules changed in 1980. It worked, so that is how it stayed.</p>
<p>For all the advertising for the State of Origin, Aussie Rules has
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures#Top_10_leagues_in_average_attendance">higher average attendances</a>
, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures#Top_leagues_in_recent_domestic_club_championship_event_attendance">highest Grand final attendances</a>
.</p>
<p>Anyway, what could I do; he's a mate, so I went to the pub to watch the first game of 2015 series. In the lead up to the game starting, watching one of the Queensland players beating his chest; it reminded me of a nature documentary I'd seen on gorillas.  Needless to say, the game was shit house
<a href="#10" name="top10">
<sup>
10
</sup>
</a>
. Finally, Queensland, who hit their heads slightly less than the New South Wales side, fumbled the ball, accidentally kicked a field goal and went on to win by the one point. Amazing. Kicking is not something rugby players can do.</p>
<p>So the better game; Aussie Rules. Watch the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BAaCBC1V1Q">big men fly</a>

.  They can run, kick, jump, and have necks.</p>
<p>My team: St Kilda.  Go the Saints!</p>
<p>Recently I was able to watch St Kilda Vs Melbourne (STK Saints V Melb Demons) Round 11. A great game! Here's the last 2 minutes:</p>

                <p>Arrrrgggh, it was cold last night. I managed to camp on top of a hill, but the frost on the ground told the story. A fair bit of standing in the sun, hands under my armpits, talking to myself like a pirate. This was to be the last cold night though.  Just outside Broggabilla, it was a balmy 8C overnight.</p>
<p>A quick run through Goondiwindi for shopping. Then on northwards.</p>
<p>Leaving Goondiwindi, I managed to miss the turn off, maybe it was enjoying the tailwind. I've been along the road too many times, something wasn't right. Stopped, checked the map. Yep, missed the turn off. Bit later, I was sure I was on the right road;  narrow, no shoulder, lots of truck traffic and roadside rubbish. Yep, going the right way now.</p>
