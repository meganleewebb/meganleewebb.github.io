<p>After sitting about all day, doing not a lot. I decided not to go to the reserve yet. My hand was quiet sore, red and a bit swollen. I worried that it was getting infected.</p>
<p>By the next day it was clear that it wasn't. So I headed out. Nice day. Top of 31C, warm enough to brave a swim.</p>
<p>Lucky  I did then. Later in the day it clouded over and the temp dropped.. Been quiet nippy since then. Cloudy, showers, wind. Cold snap. Was 2C this morning when I woke, and I was on a hill.</p>
<p>With that sort of weather, I lay about alot. Didn't do much. Watched the the traffic go past.</p>
<p>Worrying sight: father driving 4x4, with daughter(?) sitting on bull bar.</p>

<p>Reluctant to throw things away, I spend a lot of time mending.</p>
<p>My normal task is sewing patches in my pants. They wear just in a few spots at first; where the seat rubs. Later, as the fabric starts to fail, patches sprout all over. Even patches on patches. Until, I have to concede defeat. I try to salvage some of the fabric for patches, but usually it's not worth it. The combination of sun, sweat and dirt is the end of the cloth.</p>
<p>Lately been darning my socks. The heels and the toes wear fastest. Right foot faster than the left, or maybe that sock is older. Not sure. All my socks are black. They don't stay in pairs, so the current right could be newer.</p>
<p>As you can see, my work is functional, with an arty look.</p>

                <p>Well, took three days to get to Wellington. Lots of dirt roads; hills, sand, head scratching. GPS and paper maps didn't agree, and at times neither matched the roads. So did some exploring. Was all fun.</p>
<p>Unlike the angry young man from Binnaway, the young men I met were all very friendly. Guys driving somewhere - stopping to see if I'm okay, or needed anything. That is the way it normally is.</p>
<p>From Wellington, decided to go to Ponto Falls Reserve. GPS shows two routes. One on back roads over a large hill, the other along the highway.</p>
<p>I take the hill.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>I could see the river in the distance. Met a farmer, and yeah, I'm on the wrong side. He showed me the river. Yep. 50m north is where I want to be. To get there is going to be another 40km - back to Wellington and then out on the other route. He lets me camp on his land. Though, just on dusk, after moving my tent twice, I moved out to the road side. His cows kept getting spooked seeing the tent and running around. I didn't think I'd sleep too well with that. Was worried they might walk over me.  But as it happened, I didn't sleep to well anyway.</p>
<p>After dark, all the irrigation pumps started. Fuel motors. Run all night until about 4am. Probably was louder near the river. I was about a kilometer away. Also during the night, I spiked my hand on something sharp under the tent- that wakes you up in a hurry. Can see the puncture marks this morning. Also have needle holes in the tent bathtub to fix sometime. Think it was just dry grass stalks, as didn't find anything spikey under the tent.</p>
<p>So it will be a day of just relaxing in the sun, instead of all the jobs I was going to do.</p>

<p>Just on dawn a small shower drifts in. Just enough to dampen the ground, and the tent. But oh, the smells it brings out. The air is alive with smells; soil, dust, hay, wet blanket (paddock of sheep nearby), and others unidentifiable. Want to keep inhaling, to not miss out.</p>
<p>30km to Dunedoo, 10km to Mendooran. I go to Mendooran. The oldest town for something. But it's a dying town. Cafe closed and for sale, shop for sale, houses for sale. You guess that no one is buying. The helpful NRMA man doesn't know about the road my GPS is suggesting to Wellington. The area is a swamp, could be a fire trail there he says. He suggests an alternative that he knows exists. Off I go, but, another change of plan. Down a dirt road, and then into Dunedoo after all.</p>
<p>Dunedoo surprises me with Neptune. I thought I was done with the solar system.</p>

                <p>It's the end of school holidays. Parents with kids abound. But the parents aren't really present. Kids on the play equipment, parents, attention glued to their phone. It looks wrong. What message does that give the child? This phone is more interesting than you?</p>
<p>Heading out of town, I unexpectedly encounter Saturn. I'd missed most of the solar system! It's childishly amusing to see that I'm heading towards Uranus. I won't see it though, as I'll be off on a dirt road before then. Uranus, the  seventh largest planet, the only one named from Greek mythology, rather than Roman. It's only been visited once in 1986 by Voyager 2, as it flew past on the way to Neptune.</p>
<p>Eating breakfast in Binnaway, I watch a magpie swooping the kids. It doesn't go for me. Maybe it spies the tanned, dried feet hanging off my bike, and suspects it could end up like that if it comes too close. Maybe it likes kids as they are smaller. Later it does take a few swoops at me, bouncing off my head. So much for that theory.</p>
<p>I ignore the angry young man, who threatens to run me over. Though, I do wait until he has driven off north, then I continue heading south. My dirt road waits for me. Later I chat with a couple of farmers. Amongst other things, they tell me the turn onto a road I was planning to take doesn't exist any more. I'd been a bit iffy about that bit too, suspecting the GPS might not have the right info. But that's ok. It had been an enjoyable ride so far. With all the talk, the sun is sinking. After we part, I camp a few kilometers further on in some trees.</p>
