                <p>Thanks to the kind hospitality of Orange resident William, offering a place to stay. He had room inside, but I choose the back yard. I like my tent, my home.</p>
<p>A day of rest, then back out. William weighed my gear, 40kg back wheel, 24kg front wheel, and me. "Too heavy" was said. He was to wise not to comment on my weight, but did say he weighed less.</p>
<p>I think I influenced him though. He took his heavy bike for the ride out with me.</p>
<p>Not enough low gears though. He struggled to stay behind me on the hills. Had to rush to the top and rest till I arrived.</p>
<p>After William turned to return home, I continued to Molong.</p>
<p>The road to Gumble looked quiet, so off I went. And soon had problems. Flat tire. I couldn't figure out how, as it was a long cut in the direction of the tube, on the inside. Patched it. Got 10km, patch it again. New glue this time. Stopped for the night near Gumble. A locality now with only the community hall left.</p>
<p>Next morning all started good. Till another deflation. I changed the tube, and changed course to return to Orange. No other bike shops for a long time, so better to get a spare tubes now.</p>
<p>The new tube lasted 20km. This time I was sure it was the rim tape. Added duct tape over the top, and got another 15km before flat again. Never had I so much trouble with rim tape, tubes.</p>
<p>The last 30km into Orange was slow. Walk up hills, pumping the tube up, roll down. Repeat. It felt good when I arrived.</p>
<p>Bought new cloth rim tape, spare tubes, glue and patches. Hopefully it's all sorted now.</p>
<p>I couldn't impose on William again, so a night in the van park before I head out again.</p>

<p>It was a slow trip to Hill End.

, meant it wasn't going to be flat easy pedaling.</p>
<p>Maybe the trip too Orange would be better.</p>
<p>I chose the Dixon Long Point track. 4 wheel drive only, with a river crossing 20 km from the start. Okay, it wasn't easy pedaling either. But it did delivered on views and low traffic.</p>
<p>An unknown was how deep the water crossing would be. I'd been told everything from bone dry, to waist deep. With the daily storms, it seemed no one knew.</p>
<p>Only ankle deep.</p>

<p>A very early start out of Sydney. Hot, humid and hilly, but I've a grin from ear to ear. It's good to be out cycling again.</p>

<p>Was in a ride state by the Sunday, but then I spent four days working on a new chain case. The old one was white core-flute, the new is black polypropylene(?); from a discarded A0 art folio. It is thinner, as stiff as core-flute, and holds its shape better.  I have plans for more improvements, but, next year.</p>
<p>The clean and shiny look won't last long. I am returning to where I left off. The forecast for the next week; daily showers and thunderstorms.</p>

                <p>Wow! That was a fast delivery!
<a href="http://www.surlybikes.com/">Surly</a>
shipped it express! How's that for service! I'm still blown away with how wonderful they have been to me.</p>
<p>I got the call yesterday morning, but had things happening, so couldn't get down until this morning.</p>
<p>Sleepless night.</p>
<p>By 9:30 I was waiting outside.
Cheeky Transport <sup><a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> for http://www.cheekytransport.com.au</sup>
opens at 10:00.  I didn't want to be late.</p>
<p>Time slows when your waiting. But of course, it does pass.</p>

<p>Quick check and drool, then Donny got to work. Faced off the headset and bottom shell and cleaned the threads. Didn't fit the bottom bracket yet, but did fit the head set cups. Also did a quick check of the rear drop-outs for alignment; they are perfect. Then it was off to get some supplies before that first feed.  Lots of time to admire the paint, welds, braze-ons and stickers. Lots more braze-ons now!</p>
<p>It's been a warm day, just right for what I had planned:
<a href="http://surlybikes.com/info_hole/spew/spew_care_and_feeding_of_your_steel_frame">Care and feeding of your new frame</a>
.</p>
<p>She's now sitting in the kitchen on newspaper, oozing. Luckily I'm here alone, else I've a feeling we'd both be out in the garden shed. Feeding was messy. We both got covered. I won't need to moisturise tonight.
<a href="http://www.whiteknightpaints.com.au/specialty-paints/metal/rust-guard/prep/fish-oil">White Knight Rust Guard Fish Oil</a>
isn't as fishy as it could be, but its not completely odourless.  Maybe when it dries a bit more.  Just need to shoo the neighbourhood cats away until then.</p>
<p>There are a lot of rust preventative products about. But, think of this: fish swim in the sea all day, and they don't rust.</p>
<p>Well, sheep don't rust either, but the hardware didn't have Lanolin, so fish oil it was.</p>
<p>It's gone 36C here today, so so maybe she will be dry by morning for assembly.</p>
