                <p>While wandering about the Gold Coast, I spied this:</p>

<img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/bike.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Not seen too many of these about. Nice bike though.</p>
<p>Heading north, I didn't linger anywhere. The trip was very uneventful. Just days of driving. Not very interesting.  Lots of road trains about:</p>

</a></p>
<p>I'm now up north, sweltering in the winter temps: 22C overnight, 86% humidity. Daytime temps have hit 27C.  I miss the cooler weather down south.</p>

<p>Well its cooler up high. Temps been dropping to 3C overnight. And had a few light showers. No problems in the metal tent for water getting in, but it has been a bit tough getting up and moving early.   I have found condensation down low in the van - on the bottom of bottles and tins in my storage system. I'm not sure if this is from my breathing in the van - without the window open, or just from travelling from low areas to high areas with cooler temps, and not adequate ventilation to dry it out. I opened out the storage area and it all dried up, but the next night it was back again. Will need to keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>After the cooler weather, I dropped down to the coast for a night near Byron Bay. Much warmer at 18C.  Seemed lots of angry people about when I was lunching in the park. Guys yelling aggressively at one another. Pushing, shoving, name calling, lots of expletives. Uncomfortable to be around, so I didn't. Diving out, passing the servo another blue in progress. Yicks - what was it with Sunday?</p>
<p>Now staying with friends for a few days on the Gold Coast before deciding if to just head up the coastal road, or to track inland for a bit.</p>

                <p>Well, time to farewell Sydney again and head north. First stop for the day is my old favourite: Broke</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/broke.jpg" >
<img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/broke.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>A bit or history for the place. Its certainly a lot smaller now.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/bridge.jpg" >
<img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/bridge.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Found the above information board near the new bridge Looking at the water flowing underneath, I dare say it was probably a lot deeper back in those days. At the moment it looks like you could hop across without wetting your feet.  The bridge is high off the water, so the floods would be a sight to see.</p>
<p>I left Sydney after the morning peak hours rush was over and this time it was a lot less busy getting out. The trip still took me four and a half hours driving time. Yeah, I wasn't rushing at all. Stopped several times for a break.  Just cruised along gently along the Putty Road. I thought it was very scenic.  Day dreamed about cycling along it.. I still having bicycle withdrawal symptoms. Still got my bike with me in the van though. And do get out and ride it. But not the same as days touring. Trade offs...</p>
<p>Time is a passing. And this clock says it all:</p>

                <p>The weather in Sydney the last few days has been wonderful. Too good to be inside, I've been out walking the streets, checkout out some of our great buildings like this one:</p>

<p>Okay, maybe not the best building I saw.  But tucked away in the same area was:</p>

<p>My trip into Sydney was delayed a bit by the record temperatures forecast. I was still up near Armidale at that time and decided to stick around up in the mountains and not experience 46C temperatures.</p>
<p>First item of business was to get the van serviced. I mentioned to the guy that recommended Bears Auto Clinic for getting my windscreen fixed that they did a terrible job. (<a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2013/01/2013-01-10-a-real-shoddy-job-by/">See here</a> for the full story.) He immediately called up Bears and spoke to them, then told me to go around and talk with them. So I did. I didn't expect much from this. As I complained when I picked the van up about only fixing part of the windscreen and not all of it. Was told then that it would have cost more to fix all the window, even though the quote has "Rust around front screen" on it. Not: rust on bottom of windscreen. So, went around and spoke with Michael (again) at Bears. He was all sorry that I'd had a bad experience, blamed everyone else: the window installers (leaking windows), and the paint suppliers (rust started within a month of the paint inside the van), and promised to call me back after speaking to them. That was last Thursday morning.  Lets say I'm still waiting for his call.</p>
