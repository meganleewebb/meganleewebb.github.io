                <p>More time has passed than I had thought.  After the last post, 2016 can be summed up as 'lots of injuries and illnesses.'</p>
<p>I flew back to Sydney, with bits of my cart and stayed at a friends. Spent a lot of time waiting in doctors surgeries, taking tables, applying creams and ointments and hoping for a cure. I had a couple of skin infections from the tropics, but had three cases of bites (tick, leech, spider?)  that became swollen and infected also.  Besides losing some finger and toe nails, all turned out okay in the end.</p>
<p>I wasn't happy with the three wheeled pram, so had a period of building carts:</p>

<p>Another one wheeler.</p>
<p>There were many more. Some didn't get finished before it became clear the design would not work.  Most where one and two wheels.  A solitary four wheel idea never made it off paper.</p>
<p>Also was footwear experiments. Two of the wearable attempts:</p>

<p>The footwear kept me busy the longest.  Walking started out simple, but then became more complicated. What could be so hard - put shoes on and walk. Most of us have this sorted by year one.  For me, years of bicycle riding (without stretching), with a lot of pushing a heavy bicycle on cambered road edges, in sandals that were too narrow for my feet had left me with more than a few problems.</p>
<p>Besides pain from my toes pressing together, my feet faced different directions - great for pushing loaded bike uphill, not so great for long distance walking.</p>
<p>I bought a pair of Vibram Five Fingers.  Loved them at first. Then they fell out of favour because they don't dry out as well as sandals. Gradually, they returned, though I change to sandals in the rain or on wet paths.  Back to being very fond of them.  Love the way your toes can spread out. I credit them for solving the toe press problems.  Standing barefeet, all my toes have a gap between them. Some smaller than others, but coming from needing to put foam spacers between some toes to sleep at night, this is a huge improvement.</p>
<p>I walk barefoot more and more. I'd like to be barefoot full time, but roadside edges are not friendly places for bare feet: glass, thorns and metal fragments. I'm not willing to risk lack of mobility from injury.  Stepping on a rusty tin can, hidden in the grass is not a bare foot feeling I want to experience.</p>
<p>The home made footwear making started as a search for an alternative to the Vibrams, that allowed my toes to spread out more. I found it hard to find sandals that don't cramp the toes.  Making your own footwear is interesting. There is more involved in it than it appears. The experimenting  continues - my current sandal is a combination of a commercial sandal that I cut apart with a different sole I glued on.</p>

<p>Went for a walk for a couple of days. Averaged 17km per day, which doesn't sound like much. I'm suffering big time in the heat and humidity. Middle of winter and it's hitting 28c with feels like of 30. Overnight lows of low 20s. Doesn't feel like winter at all.</p>
<p>Been doing 6km walks with hiking poles. That was all okay. Starting from the family home first thing in the morning. Got a cart to carry my gear, but the it had a faulty wheel. Only just received the replacement.</p>
<p>Feet a little sore, but it's to be expected. Was worried about blisters at the end of day one, but they settled overnight. I put tape over the likely spots the next day. Not sure I can carry enough tape though.</p>

<p>My first loaf that I'm having for brunch. Four tea candles for 45 minutes. The bread is soft, but I'll experiment more now that I'm on the road and try for a crust.</p>

                <p>I did leave Sydney with the K-Mart bike to head north.  The bike worked well. The front forks stayed rigid and showed no signs of movement. Gearing was higher than I'd like - so did a fair bit of walking. With all the walking, I started having foot problems. My feet were still not up to walking much. With most of the trip still to go, I decided to return to Sydney to recover.</p>
<p>The body healed with rest, but then there was a family incident, so I flew to Cairns with just a the essentials in a backpack - electronics, sleeping bag, clothes, cooking gear, tarp, bug net and miscellaneous items. I like to be independent. The original plan was to either fly back to Sydney or walk with the backpack. However, the walk from the airport had me thinking that some wheels might be better. So after much searching about, I found some.</p>

<p>It sounds really alluring to just drop everything and go explore the world for the rest of your life. However, now isn’t the right time for me but in the future the option might just re-open for me as the thought is still present. Sydney is indeed a nice place to hit with so many attractions and sceneries to enjoy and countless other cities within Australia as well.</p>

                <p>After two council clean ups in the area - one awesome, and one disappointing. Or maybe the first one spoilt me. It was time to head north. Departure planned, bike loaded up, test ride down a hill. hmmm, front brakes shuddering.  Better fix that.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The forks wear just looking at them.</figcaption>
</a>
</figure>

<p>More investigation found the shuddering was caused by the forks. They had a worrying amount of forward/backward movement. The brake grips the rim, the forks rock forward, the brake slips, the fork spring back. The brake grips again and on it goes.  Not ideal.</p>

<figcaption>Plastic bush pulled out. No so visible in this pic, but it has flattened out.</figcaption>
</a>
</figure>

<p>The cause was the plastic bushes wearing and flattening out. I knew this was going to happen and had wrapped the forks in plastic to keep grit out. That probably didn't slow the wear rate much. The forks on the Kmart Bike are the worst thing about it. The fix: convert to rigid forks.  Ideally, this would involve changing the forks. But the 'will this work' solution involved string, paper, hose clamps and epoxy resin.  Ideally, I wanted to disassemble them and change the spring in the base to a piece of metal pipe. But that needs a really long extension tool that I don't have. So with the plastic bush out as per the above photo. I wrapped string around the stanchion, and pressed it down with the bush into the fork. Checking with a piece of wire, I plugged any large gaps with paper, then filled the tube up with 5 minute epoxy resin. Before it set, I pushed the bush into it, so that resin was pushed back up filling all the gaps and channels in the bush. Effectively the top 60mm of the fork is now (hopefully) resin. Hose clamps went on the top of that, so if the fork does want to compress, they will stop it moving, or at least limit its movement.</p>
<p>With the resin set, the forks are now rigid. Brake shuddering has gone. Time will tell how how travel affects the "fix". It might last months, or fail on the next ride.</p>
<p>The KMart Bike adds excitement to each trip:)</p>
<p>I did check the wheel bearings. Well, at least the front ones. Heaps of grease in there. All good.  The rear, I realised I don't have the tool to get the cluster off, so they'll have to wait a bit longer. But grease is oozing out, so there is heaps in there.  The headset bearings also were well greased.</p>
<p>Other work was adding water bottle holders. I made these out of some aluminium strips found in the council clean up.  I can carry 10 litres in 1.25L PET bottles; two on each side of the forks, two in the triangle, and two behind the handlebars on the top tube. I still have the basket empty, so could put another couple of bottles in there.  All the water up front will balance the gear on the rear rack.  Gear weight is about 15kg and mostly (see below) fits in my two large homemade panniers. This is down from the 30kg I carried on the Surly.  I'm still not on board with 'minimal' though, I'll be leaving with way too much food for my route.  One day I'll get this right. So I'll work at reducing the food I've got and not stocking up so much each time.</p>
<p>I say "mostly", because I have two sleeping bags for now and while I can get both in my panniers, it is easier to keep one out on top of the rack in a dry bag. I use the sleeping bags as quilts. I'm using a $15 KMart summer weight sleeping bag. Synthetic, rated at 11C-15C, weighing 850 grams.  I've used this one down to 7C wearing thermals and clothing to bed, but I'm expecting lower temperatures in Northern NSW. So I scavenged another bag from a bin. It is missing a zipper, is synthetic, and weighs the same, so probably the same rating. With both, I sleep toasty. When I'm in Queensland and no longer need it, I'll return it to a bin. I won't need two bags again until winter next year.</p>
<p>My previous down sleeping bag was rated to about 0C, and I'd used it below wearing thermals and clothes. It weighed about 1500 grams, washing and drying it was not easy and I constantly was worried about it getting wet or damp. It would get dirty and salted. I'd get it cleaned by an outdoor company in Sydney at a cost of $60 a time, usually every second year.  After the last wash, the down was still clumping, so it needed replacing.  I was initially thinking of a new down bag. But at hundreds of dollars, and then the special washing needs, it wasn't very appealing. Most of the time, the temperature isn't below 10C and is above 15C.  The KMart bag at $15 is half the weight, easy to wash and dry. Can throw it in the washing machine and dryer. Though, depending on the laundromat costs, that could approach the cost of a new bag. Or I'll just replace it with another one. For the few months of winter when I need warmer, I'll add a second bag. The Kmart bag is much better value.</p>
