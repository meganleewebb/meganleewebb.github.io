                <p>Claws on cement. I call out, thinking it's a dog. "Get away", "go on". The claws continue. Rolling over and looking in the half light, it's small. Possum I think. Then I wake fully, too low for that. It keeps coming towards me, reaching the tent.  I scramble for the torch. Arrrrrggh!!! Echidna! Now I'm rushing to open the zip, and stop out before it tries to push underneath. I stop it on my door mat. It "digs in" Phew.</p>
<p>Discarding my "no intervention" ideal, I move it, on the mat, around my tent, onto the grass, and go back to bed. Saved!</p>

                <p>An underappreciated pleasure: warm dry clothing. It's a cool day and I'd just washed myself and cloths, when the showers start. Not wanting to get another set wet, I squeeze as much water out as I can, then put them back on. They'll dry faster with a heater in them, even if the heater doesn't enjoy the sensation.</p>
<p>Quiet day after that, listening to the rain on the zinc roof under a picnic shelter.</p>
<p>It showers, drizzles or rains during the night. When I wake, it continues. I fail to leave.</p>
<p>I find out the locals have all been talking about the poor woman in her tent at the picnic shelter. When the fourth person comes over to offer somewhere out of the wind and rain, I give in. More to ease their worries than from concern about the wind and rain. I move to another larger shelter, out of sight. It's also more peaceful, people wise. Empty sheds nearby, roofing iron clangs in the wind makes a memorable night.</p>

                <p>Meet up with
<a href="http://time4tour.com/">Tim the Tourist</a>
in Boree Creek before going to Narrandera We first met up Far North Queensland last year. Kept in touch on email. First time I've met another traveller in two states. Hung out, ate too much, drank too much, did some chores, and had an enjoyable time. Also avoided riding in the 42C days. Ended up staying longer than I'd planned as the temps stayed high. But eventually, it was time to go.</p>
<p>I was glad to get away from the caravan park. Had the idea the owners hate having people there. Bins not emptied, lights not working, taps leaking, coin BBQ swallowed coins, and failed to start, toilets without paper, toilet block locked. And the constant, 24x7 elevator music. Arrrgggh. Not one I'd stop at again, even though it was near the lake and town swimming pool.</p>
<p>Riding; start early in the day while it's cooler (25c), stop by lunch time when it really heats up (38c). Sweat lots in the heat and humidity. Batten down for the passing storms.</p>
<p>Pass through small dying towns each day. The buildings closed. Weathered and fading signs showing the business that once existed there.  The servo is going as well. No people needed. Replaced with a credit card browser.</p>
<p>Had a moment walking into a shop yesterday. Something has happened somewhere and the morning tv show was in full overblown emotion showing. The serious, shocked, outraged looks on the presenters. The shop staff clustered around the tv, not to miss anything. TV flashes to photos of men with beards and headwear.  That is when I walked in, still covered up, to order a burger.</p>
<p>Need to keep track of the days better. Tullibigeal. Nothing is open on the weekend. And today I just found out is Saturday..</p>
<p>Edit: Not true. I was to early for a weekend. The Tullicafe opens everyday. They make a great burger.</p>

                <p>It was quiet when I rode into Urana. Ok, it was early in the morning, but it didn't change as the day lengthened.  I stayed in the park, until after lunch, when a bus of young guys arrived. Well lubricated, they were having a good time, and wanted everyone to know it.</p>
<p>I headed out towards Boree Creek and found a camp. Very quiet; only saw one car pass by.  Needless to say, my NYE was very peaceful. The weather was dry, with no wind. I left the fly off the tent, and went to bed early. Woke a few times to watch the stars.</p>

<p>The ride into Boree Creek had me wondering if I was on a road, or just going through a farmers paddock.</p>

<p>There is a sculpture in Boree Creek of a swaggie. Very well done I thought. The same artist also created this at Morundah:</p>

<p>With a couple of 42C days forecast, I decided to spend a few days resting at Narrandera.</p>

                <p>Felt much better when I woke. Peaceful ride into Walbundarie. It's larger than I was expecting. I'm ravenous, eat my breakfast, quarter of a watermelon, a loaf of fruit bread and a handful of cashew nuts. Still I'm hungry, but decide to leave. Better to be a bit hungry than stuffed full.</p>
<p>A tail wind leaving, and it is good, until it moves to a cross wind, and strengthens.</p>
<p>I'm walking. The wind is roaring. Black clouds grow. I head down a narrow dirt track to get to a parallel road. But riding is impossible. Even walking is difficult. Just as rain drops hit, I find a bush to hide behind. There are other trees about, but none I trust to shelter under.</p>
<p>I watch the storm pass. Not enough rain to wet me. But the wind continues. Eventually I decide to find better shelter. More walking.</p>
<p>An hour later, I find it. A stand of Casuarina trees. I wait in vain for the wind to drop. Dust clouds are whipped up.</p>
<p>I watch the fire brigade speed past, and look anxiously for a fire. Impossible to tell with the dust. No smell of smoke.</p>
<p>As darkness falls, I'm not going anywhere. Still too windy.  A couple hours later it eases.</p>
<p>Next morning, in Walbundarie, I learn the fire was at Rand. But it's out now.</p>
<p>Rand, when I arrive it's a ghost town. Or maybe aliens have abducted everyone. I stop for lunch. Then riding around the town, still see no one. Slightly spooky. I head off towards Urana.</p>
<p>Later I see a ute driving up and down in a paddock. Is this what country people do instead of driving round and round the block? Nope, Jay is doing EM Mapping. Up and back, 30 meters apart, for the whole field, dragging the sensor. He tells me of fields that are 8km in length. Long uneventful days, just driving up and back. I guess it is a job that drones will replace in the future.</p>
