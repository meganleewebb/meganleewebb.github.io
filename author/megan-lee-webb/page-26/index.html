<p>Been doing some rides about Perth, and generally lazying about.</p>
<p>Yesterday decided to go check out the bike polo games. Got the</p>
<p>information from
<a href="http://www.bikepolo.com.au/cities/perth/">http://www.bikepolo.com.au/cities/perth/</a>
and rocked</p>
<p>up.  The game they play is "Hardcourt Bike Polo" or "Urban Bike Polo".</p>
<p>Check out the rules</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_polo#Hardcourt_bike_polo">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_polo#Hardcourt_bike_polo</a></p>
<p>Most of the bikes were fixed gear or single speed. I used my bike -  after taking off the mirror and lowering the bar ends. </p>
<p>It was heaps of fun. Going to have to go back an play some more. </p>

                <p>Yay!!! My bike is back. New seals on the Rohloff, new chain and sprockets. Been out riding each day.  Yesterday was in one of the parks and got to listen to some live music. Guess it was part of some fathers day celebrations.</p>
<p>Today, I got to watch dolphins playing near the shore. I was the only one there. They played for around 20 minutes about a buoy, then moved along the shore a bit before vanishing. A show, just for me.</p>

<p>Had the flu for the past week, so been spending lots of time sleeping. Today the weather was spot on, so I borrowed a bike and went for a ride along the river. My rear wheel is in getting seals changed on the Rohloff but should be back next week.  One of the buildings along the way...</p>

<p>Okay. A bit behind on the journal updates. Catching up now, all in one post on the trip down to Perth.</p>
<p>Currently resting up in Perth, eating lots, replacing and repairing gear. The big items  that need work:</p>
<p>bike - time for another Rohloff oil change. Drive chain side oil seal may be leaking oil. Not a problem as noted on the German Rohloff website, but I'd like to get it fixed.</p>
<p>Bike - make a new chain case. The old one has worked well, but it could be better. Will have a bigger choice of plastic in Perth to make the improved version.</p>
<p>Bike - seat and handlebar grips need patching or replacing from wear.</p>
<p>Tent - time to get a new one, or patch the holes. Actually I've decided this already and am going to make my own. Should be able to drop the weight from 4kg to around 1.5kg for a two person, mossie net and bath tub setup.  I'll write more on this as I build it.</p>
<p>Panniers- my home made set has been getting lots of patches. They are more than ten years old now. Since I'm going to make a new tent, I'll make another set out of new material. I'll get to ride about Perth and test them before I leave to ensure they hold up.  If the new ones work, I'll make another set and replace all my panniers. Weight loss will be at least 2kg which with the tent will save about 5kg.</p>
<p>Since I'm cutting the weight, I'll take the scales to my gear and see what else can go on a diet.  Should be able to save another kilo or two that way. Ideally I'll drop six or seven kilos from my gear list before I leave Perth. I'm  not expecting that to happen fast.  Wandering about the city today checking out the camping shops, found the Munda Biddi Foundation office.  Was so excited - bicycle track. Will definitely ride some of that. Sarah there was so helpful and friendly. Thanks heaps.</p>
<p>Also looking at doing some short  walks - the Bibbulmun Track looks interesting. Its only 1000km</p>
<p>But not until I get my bike gear sorted. The light tent will be good for that also. Anyway, more on that later..</p>
<p>Update on getting to Perth:  Was glad to get out of Port Hedland area. I left about midnight from the caravan park. There was still a fair bit of traffic at that time. Road trains moving ore and gas, and general goods. But they dropped of by the time I was past the Newman turn off.  Was feeling like resting, so stopped riding before Whim Creek. Saved that for the next day. Nice little pub. Food and a game of pool. If you ever call past - say hi to Harry.  Roebourne plains was next. That was exciting. Large empty plains of short grass, with a strong head wind, but hid out in a creek bed that was so nice, I stayed two days. Would have stayed another day, but needed water.  Next was the food and water stop in Karratha. It was a quick stop, get supplies and leave. Reminded me of Port Hedland. Lots of cars and trucks, not many people walking or cycling. But it did have less road debris.  I was still night riding as the temps were up, and well, it was quieter. Got used to having the road to myself and the occasional road train. Night riding continued all the way to Nanutarra.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I started feeling sick after leaving Karratha. I had passed the Fortescue roadhouse by about 40km, and instead of turning back, pushed on. It was a tough few days with short distances and lots of resting. Spent all of one day in one spot. It was a struggle to get to Nanutarra. With the next roadhouse 200km, and the next town 140km after that, I decided to get the bus to Perth to recover. Spent three more days waiting for a bus, and then 20hours travelling. Not sure what it was - bad water, bad food, a build up of fatigue from long rides without enough rest, some other bug. Nausea, tiredness and weak. Was feeling lots better after three days just waiting for the bus.  Met a German cycle rider at Nanutarra. He was on a two week holiday and rode from Broome and was heading south. We shared thoughts on the towns and both agreed on Port Hedland.  He was relying on the caravan crowd to get water. I wonder if this is just a overseas visitor idea or if Australian riders do it also. I'm happy with 23liters and a plan to get between known water spots, than needing to ask caravan people all the time.  Photos: There isn't much water about..  Kangaroos are strays?  Robe River did have water in it. Was a nice spot to hangout for a day. Stayed there, slept, washed, rested. This was after Karratha. </p>

                <p>Huh. So much for weather reports. It got to 34C after leaving the roadhouse.</p>
<p>I Just before leaving I met Aitor and Evelin, cycling from Boome south. So we rode together for a bit. Wow. Evelin only started cycling from Darwin. Amazing. Picking to my mind the hardest place to start touring in. Aitor has been on the road two years.</p>
<p>It was hot. So that night I left them and continued my night cycling.</p>
<p>One thing about over here, is that once the day warms up i doesn't cool in the afternoon. It needs the night to cool down. I miss that on the east coast - how its hot in the middle of the day, but cooler in the afternoon.</p>
<p>So cycling at night, trying to find some shade and then rest or sleep in the heat.  Tiring it has been. Been some days just so tired, that I have slept for a couple of hours in the middle of the day. But a lot of sleepless times.</p>
<p>On night a car with a trailer passed fast. Two hours later I found them in the bushes on the right hand side. They where okay - and getting the car back on the road and then the trailer out. I didn't stay about as they said I couldn't help. I wasn't going to argue with them..  An hour and a half later they passed fast again. I don't think they learn't their lesson.</p>
<p>Sitting in the shade in the day I see all the small creatures: so many differant ants, beetles, bees, wasps, spiders, lizards, birds. More wildlife than I thought would be about. Cause at night i see snakes and bugs. Not seeing to much of the  larger animals. Welll, there was a kangaroo that almost hit me. What is it about them - i'm not going that fast. It bound from the road edge just in front of me across the road. Road kill for sure if it does that with anything else.</p>
<p>Been lucky - it showered one night - not enough to dampen everything. Just enough to give the smell of rain and a hint of coolness.</p>
<p>Then past Sandfire Roadhouse it really showered and rained. Got wet. But was happy it was 15C and cool. Such a releif after all the hot days and nights. I was riding in the morning when it started. That night I slept well. First time in a while.  Slept from 5pm through to 7am. Then had breakfast, before cycling in the day for the first time.</p>
<p>Breakfast was in the tent - lots of flies. The pesty ones that walk all over your face and dive onto the spoon from the pot to your mouth. Arrrghhh.. So annoying those flies. Eat in the tent.</p>
<p>DeGray River rest area was the first one I stopped at for a long time. Well not much reason to stop at them at night, and in the morning - just looking for a place to crash and avoid the sun later. One I stopped I stayed. Since I didn't want to stay in the rest area, I didn't stop.  Stopped for lunch, but ended up staying the night.  Met lots of nice people there. Got given a dish of home made pasta sauce, a packet of buscuits, and a feed of roast potatoes. All from different people.</p>
<p>Today was Port Hedland, and then South Hedland.  Hmmm Port Hedland was not pleasant.  Busy road, narrow, winds. And there is nothing in Port Hedland.  Well,  not true - there is the port. Some services.  South Hedland has shops.  Its a very spread out place. People drive everywhere. The two places are about 20km apart. Lots of trucks, 4x4 and road trains.  Busy. It was also windy. So after going into Port Hedland, it was a head wind getting out.</p>
<p>Someone said to me the port started at Port Hedland, but then the town run out of space because of the salt flats - so South Hedland was started.</p>
<p>Whatever, it was a bit dissapointing to hit the first town after leaving Derby and have to deal with Port Hedland.</p>
<p>I'm staying in a van park in South Hedland tonight. All the sweating up north, everything is loaded with salt. So while the last two days have been cooler, everything is damp as the salt absorbs the moisture at night. Washed everything today and dried it. Feels so good to have clean dry gear. The last wash/dry cycle was in Halls Creek - a long time ago.</p>
<p>Plan now is to head down the coastal route towards Perth. Looking at the map today, there are road houses spaced out more - well not too far apart. Towns are a bit sparse, but water shouldn't be a problem.  Going to head that way, can always change my mind and swing back inland if I want to.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter who you talk to about how busy the roads will be - someone will always say the other is more busy. There is definitely a lot more road trains about Port Hedland though, than I've seen getting here.</p>
<p>Not many pictures so far, as I forget to take them, and cycling at night, well, I think there is lots to see, but my phone camera won't work so well. I'm still leaving early in the mornings, but should have more day time cycling, so maybe some more pictures from now on.</p>
