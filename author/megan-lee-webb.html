                <p>I finally finished building my PVC cart. It has three modes</p>
<p>Long mode:</p>

<p>All great and wonderful. Took it for a few short walks while I was working out the bugs. Then set off on a 20km shakedown trip.</p>
<p>Few days later I started developing sore knees. I'm not sure why. The walk was easy. Nothing hard, no big hills. No rush. I took all day for 20km. So lots of resting, reading, and watching the world go by. 20km wasn't an unusual distance. My daily morning constitutional was 12km at a brisk pace. Then the days activities were on top of that. Usually a lot more walking, but some cycle rides.</p>
<p>A physio visit later and the diagnosis was "tendonitis". Treatment: Noting surprising. Cut the activity levels right down. Cycling is preferable as it's low impact. Only about two or three months to recover. ðŸ˜¦</p>
<p>So, here I am, recovering, <span style="font-weight:900">again</span>. Starting to feel that the idea of walking with a cart is jinxed.</p>

                <p>One of the surprises about my recent holiday was the how interesting walking about the inner west is.</p>
<p>Walkability<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is one of those concepts that sounds simple, and that you don't notice, until there is a large change, and then suddenly you wonder how you didn't notice it before.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information about walkability. A brief video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4kmDxcfR48">what makes a city great</a>. And more on urban planning.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.walkscore.com/apartments/search/AU-NSW/Sydney">Using this map</a> I have been staying in a <span style="color:Red">Red Zone</span>. Not walkable. My holiday was in a <span style="color:Lime">Green Zone</span>. Very walkable. The difference was eye opening. I'd become habituated to blandness.</p>
<p>Presently, an hour fast walk is about 6km. Most of that is along a busy road. Off that I'm passing cookie cutter style housing. The type were every front yard is manicured to the peer accepted level. There are a couple of cafes along the way near a train station, but otherwise shops are clustered inside a shopping center. Blank boxes, designed to trap you inside, where the layout is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer">confusing and disorentating</a>. Everything planned to encourage you to <a href="https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/everyday-shopping/shopping-centres/articles/shopping-centre-design">buy more</a>.</p>
<p>It's not very interesting walking about the suburbs.</p>

<p>"A change is as good as a holiday"<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>On that: I've now had a holiday. It was to have been a week, but unexpectedly extended to over two. House sitting, well, more garden sitting. Normal stuff. Water the plants. Try not to kill anything. Easy enough. I mostly succeeded. Some over 40C days and snails did in a few seedlings. Acceptable losses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I walked a lot. Checking out the sights:</p>

<p>I like the pictures. They are easy to relate to. Tags <sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> are harder to appreciate. They are in the same group as Pollock paintings<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>; some people love them, but to everyone else, it is just unintelligible scribble. I'd rate tags higher than Pollock paintings. Tags I can see mean something. There are letters there to be found like a Magic Eye<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> puzzle. It's a code, a language, it means something. Pollock paintings just look like scribble. Something a toddler did.</p>
<p>Why is one is called "art" and put on display to sell for millions, while the other is called "graffiti" and costs millions to clean off or paint over? Listen to Malcolm Gladwell's <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/seasons">Revisionist History</a> podcast Season 5, Episode 1 <a href="http://revisionisthistory.com/episodes/42-dragon-psychology-101">Dragon Psychology 101</a> for some ideas.</p>

                <p>Mostly I don't think about YouTube's recommendation algorithm. Depending on mood, I gleefully or mindlessly scroll and click on it's suggestions. Sometimes it's fustrating for the unwanted options. I  curiously watch one video, didn't like it, but now it continually recommends more of the same. Days of my life have passed down rabbit holes. Discovering useful, fascinating, interesting, irrelevant knowledge and trivia. Occasionly it suggestions really hits a spot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz4YqwH_6D0"  target="_blank">The toolbox fallacy</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> was one such video.</p>
<p>It hit me with a hard truth. I think of myself as a traveller. But, glancing at the past posts archive, the last time I was really travelling was 2015. I can kid myself with some trips after that, but...</p>
<p>A write writes. A traveller travels. I am no longer a traveller.</p>
<p>I tell myself that I have had good reason; medical issues (true), bushfires (true), COVID (mostly true). But, I've also settled into a routine. I've gotten comfortable.</p>
<p>Sounding like excuses, I do need to stay about Sydney for longer. Summer is coming - heat &amp; bushfires, COVID continues, and I have some things plodding along requiring me to remain.</p>
<p>I want to do more travelling. I'm not certain when or if I'll leave.</p>
<p>One thing I can do now, is to use my time better. Get organised. So everything is ready. In that spirit, late one afternoon, I decided to just go for an overnight. Gather my gear together, and go test it. Specially the new stuff that has never been used. With some reluctance, (a storm rolled in), I packed and was out the door into a light shower.</p>

<p>I was very out of practice. A long list of items forgotten. Most hilarious: I had a mug, water, coffee powder, stove, fuel, but no lighter. After I'd returned, the backup fire starter was discovered at the bottom of my wallet.</p>
<p>I've had a few more trips since then. Refining the gear list. Testing, discarding and replacing items. There is still more work to do yet.</p>

                <p>I think of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween">Halloween</a> as a distinctly American tradition. Over sold, and over consumed. I'm not a fan. I pull my old persons hat down, mumble about the Americanization of Australia, and try to ignore it.</p>
<p>I also ponder the silence on the mountains of plastic ornaments consumed each year. Once they would have been hand made, or kept and treasured for years. But now, each celebration event has its own plastic merchandise that is manufactored, shipped, purchased, displayed, and then junked after the day is over. All in the space of a few days or weeks. Landfill or the ocean its out of sight, out of mind.</p>
<p>Usually the first hint of Halloween is in the shops. Stocks of fake pumpkins, spider webs, witches, ghouls, bats, cats, and treats trickle in, and then explode into end of aisle displays as the final days count down. The plastic migrates via shopping carts and motor vehicles to the yards and footpaths of suburbia. As the day approachs the amount increases. Fake plastic cobwebs multiply, hanging in the shrubs, and spilling across the ground.</p>
<p>On the day, groups of children herd from house to house crying "trick or treat" over and over. I wonder if anyone chooses 'trick'? And what the trick is these days. They soon grab their allocation of sweets and scamper off to mob the next house.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, the decorations slowly decay and are blown about the street by the wind. Actually, the responsible clean up their display. I only notice the few that don't. But they rest longer on my mind as I see them time and time again getting more tatty and weathered.</p>
<p>Regardless of my feelings on Halloween, I had to stop and admire the effort put into this one:</p>

<p>I was equally pleased to note the next time I passed that it had all been cleaned away. The graves, feeding the lawn.</p>
