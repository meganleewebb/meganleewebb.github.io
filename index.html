                <p>Been a long time since the last post. In the way of life, a lot has happened, but not much really. The <a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2022/01/new-plan-time/">New Plan Time</a> didn't happen. It started well, but, then I injured my back. ☹️</p>
<p>There's a joke that goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day the different parts of the body were having an argument to see which should be in charge.</p>
<p>The brain said "I do all the thinking so I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>The eyes said "I see everything and let the rest of you know where we are, so I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>"I should be in charge," said the heart, "I circulate oxygen and nutrients all over."</p>
<p>The hands said "Without me we wouldn't be able to pick anything up or move anything. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>The stomach said "I turn the food we eat into energy for the rest of you. Without me, we'd starve. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>The legs said "Without me we wouldn't be able to move anywhere. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>"I should be in charge," said the anus, "I am responsible for waste removal."</p>
<p>All of the other body parts laughed at the anus and insulted him. So he shut down. Within a few days, the brain had a terrible headache, the hands were all shaky, the stomach was bloated, the legs got wobbly, the eyes got watery, and the heart pumped toxic blood. They all decided that the anus should be the boss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the spine was watching with amusement.</p>
<p>Anyone with a back injury knows, when it's bad, everything is painful. Standing, sitting, lying, moving the arms, even waste removal hurts.</p>
<p>When the pain lessened, a new plan was hatched. I didn't think I'd be able to move my bike and gear about without help. Assistance was needed. I decided to dip my toe into ebikes with a "cheap" upgrade kit. This ended up not being the cheap option it first appeared. I could have bought a new ebike for less, as various components on my bike needed upgrading or changing. Still, I'm happy with the learning experience and I like the frankenstein look of my bike.</p>
<p>Now, I need some way to carry my gear, and power the ebike.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>One Ortlieb Back-Roller Classic pannier is 20L. These panniers are approximately 60L each.</p>
<p>It's not my design. Thank Ken. He created the template, and provided the instruction and materials from which my yellow panniers were made. With those, the seams were heat welded - 100% waterproof. The panniers here are sewn, and the seams waterproofed with silicone.</p>

</figure>

<p>The pattern has minimal seams, and therefor minimal sewing. The basic shape is a rectangle with one corner cut out. The corner cut out provides heel clearance. If the size is scaled down, this might not be a problem.</p>
<h4>Order of operations:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Test fabric seam sewing to determine seam allowance required.</li>
<li>Measure out the template <em>with seam allowances</em>.</li>
<li>Fold and cut the fabric.</li>
<li>From the outside side, fold top edge to the inside and hem.</li>
<li>Sew inside sleeve in.</li>
<li>Turn inside out and sew the side seam.</li>
<li>Sew in the bottom.</li>
<li>Turn right side out and sew buckles on top edge.</li>
<li>Insert the plastic reinforcener and mark hanger holes for your rack. Check forward-backward for heel clearance.</li>
<li>Drill and bolt on the hangers.</li>
<li>Bask in the glow of finished panniers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The template</h4>

<figcaption>The basic shape the pannier</figcaption>
</a>
</figure>

<p>It is 550mm wide and 800mm tall.</p>
<p>The triangle cut out is about 380mm tall and 110mm across the base.</p>
<p><em>Don't forget the seam allowance around the edge.</em> It will vary depending on the fabric and seam type. I used 30mm for a thick canvas (the green material), but 20mm for thinner fabric (beige material).</p>
<p>Fold the fabric in half. Template straight edge goes on the fold. Mark and cut out.</p>

</a>
</figure>

<h4>Plastic Sleeve</h4>
<p>A plastic reinforcener will be held in place by this sleeve. It is to stiffen the pannier and give it its shape.</p>
<p>The plastic insert is 3mm plastic. It's 250mm long at the base.  340mm wide at the top, 340mm tall.</p>
<p>The sleeve is sewn inside the where the pannier will lean against the rack. Make the sleeve material the same size as the insert <em>plus a seam allowance</em>.</p>
<p><em>Remember the panniers are left and right sided.</em> Sew the sleeve on the correct side of the material.</p>
<h4>Base</h4>
<p>The base is approximately 300mm x 250 mm <em>including seams</em>. Round the corners. It's worthwhile to check the size of the base against the pannier before cutting it out.</p>
<h4>Hangers</h4>
<p>Mine are 3mm aluminum flat bar bent into hooks. I used 6 x 30mm hot dipped galvanized bolts with a large washer on the inside. 5mm bolts would have been sufficient.</p>
<p>Use a large washer on the inside.</p>
<p>The bolts go through the sleeve, through the plastic reinforcener, the pannier, then the hanger. I left the bolts long. By sizing the hook length, the bolts protrude and stop the pannier jumping off the rack. Else, attach a elastic loop lower down from the hangers to hook on the rack.</p>

<h4>DIY Seam Sealer</h4>
<p>Mix Bunnings Silicone sealant with Mineral Turps (Turpentine). A ratio of about 1:5 silicone to turps. Thinner is better as it soaks into the fabric and doesn't peel off.  Mix well, until the silicone disolves in the turps. It should be fluid, like milk. If it is too thick, add more turps. It will mix - keep stirring. Brush on the seams. It will soak into the fabric. Allow to dry - outside.</p>

<p>COVID lockdowns are over, but I'm still in Sydney for now. But I have a plan. 2022 will be return to cycling. I'm giving up on walking. I keep injuring needing weeks to recover. Enough of that.</p>
<p>Work is in progress to get a bike ready. And I've been riding more to get some cycling fitness back.</p>

                <p>Was a roller coaster of a time with the COVID lockdown. I wasn't isolated alone. I had many visitors. Some more regular than others.</p>

<p>Not a conversationalist though. I'd walk each day. Sometimes my mate would follow up the street.</p>
<p>There was a large uptick in people walking or jogging. Very noticeable in the afternoon. Only the keen are out early on winter mornings.</p>
<p>I hatched another plan. Build a new cart. It did help keep me busy.</p>

<p>Lots of thinking on the design, drawing plans. Then the actual work. "Measure twice, cut once." says the proverb. Great advice. Doesn't help if the measurement is wrong. Mistakes were made in the plan. But harder to fix mistakes were made in the building. But eventually it was together.</p>

<p>And it seemed like suddenly, lockdown was over.</p>
<p>I'm busting to go places. But, I'm laid low again. Sore feet. Why? I don't know. Nothing changed one week to the next, but something did. Walking or cycling both affect it. I'm doing the standard protocol for recovery: rest, anti inflammatories, stretching and hoping that it heals soon. Feeling "up" on the days I wake and it feels improved. Trying not to feel "down" when it is worse.</p>
<p>And more sad news: Omelet and Dinner have departed. After the last post, I was patting myself on the back for taking good care of them. And then a magpie attacked them. Just one magpie of the couple that visit was paying them a lot of attention. I thought I had them safe in their cage. But the magpie proved smarter than me. It waited until they were close to the wire and managed to spike both of them in the head. Dinner passed on first, Omelet about a week later. I decided not to try again.</p>

                <p>I've never had my own pet before.</p>
<p>Growing up there was the household animals - cats, dogs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#Terminology">chooks</a>. And a group of brief visitors vaguely remembered like  the freshwater turtles that only lasted a night, before they baffling escaped?   Or not remembered at all:  A cow and some goats. I have idea of their fates. In a family story recounted often, the goats only lasted until they ate the sheets off the washing line.</p>
<p>The cats came and went as they wanted. Sometimes, looking healthy, other times beat up. They got fed when there where about. Their appearances grew more and more infrequent, until one day it was noticed they hadn't returned for a long time and clearly they were never coming back.  Did they move to a better place, or did they meet an untimely end. We never knew.</p>
<p>The dogs were more mum and dads pets. The inside dog was mums. Spoilt rotten. Outside dogs - dads. We kids were involved, but incidentally so - taking food out at times, or cleaning up after them. The chooks where more of our responsibility. Our, as in "all the kids" - a group commitment. Like all groups, it was an uneven commitment. Some doing more of work to avoid punishment. Collect the eggs, check the food and water, close the chook house door at night. The chooks weren't thought of as pets. They were the egg producers, and looking after them was a job that had to be done.</p>
<p>I had always wanted pigeons, but our drinking water was collected off the house roof into a rain water tank. Having pigeons, who would be sitting and pooping on the roof was never going to be allowed to happen.  I thought to get pigeons now, but with COVID lockdown that option was blocked. None of the Gumtree pigeon sales were close. But there were Quail about! So I've joined the group of people getting pets while in lockdown.</p>
<p>I was to have been gone from Sydney, but... COVID. I figured the lockdown is going to go for months, so long enough to have some pets.</p>
<p>Meet Omelet and Dinner.</p>

<p>The names are not suggesting anything. They just happened to spring to mind when I was carrying them back. Omelet does lay an egg a day. Four or five quail eggs equals one chicken egg, so any omelets are going be small, or also infrequent. Dinner, he keeps Omelet company. I wanted more, but the seller only had the pair left.</p>
<p>They have two homes. Nights are spent inside. Days outside in their larger holiday home. It's not suitable for overnight stays. Not build to a high enough predator proof rating. Cats, dogs, foxes, snakes, rats. Too many critters that would love an overnight snack. This one came past early one morning:</p>

<p>I wonder if it was the scent of quail that attracted it. I've never seen one in the yard before. Only fleeting glances when bush walking.</p>

<p>The "basket" on the front is a "Garden City Plastic Grow Plant Pot - 410mm Black 28L $6.50 " from Bunnings. It won out over the "Tactix 25L Black Collapsible Crate $9.98 " by the sleek aerodynamic shape,  lighter weight, increased volume and being slightly cheaper.  Time will tell if it is up to the rigours of life as a basket.</p>
<p>But for now, I love the space it provides. The old K-Mart wire basket was miserly with space. A bicycle lock and  my backpack with shopping was always a tight squeeze. I needed to give it a bit of encouragement to fit and even then, I didn't always succeed. This new basket it voluminous. The shopping and the bicycle lock vanish inside with ample room for more goods.  A good sized basket is essential in my opinion.</p>

                <p>I finally finished building my PVC cart. It has three modes</p>
<p>Long mode:</p>

<p>All great and wonderful. Took it for a few short walks while I was working out the bugs. Then set off on a 20km shakedown trip.</p>
<p>Few days later I started developing sore knees. I'm not sure why. The walk was easy. Nothing hard, no big hills. No rush. I took all day for 20km. So lots of resting, reading, and watching the world go by. 20km wasn't an unusual distance. My daily morning constitutional was 12km at a brisk pace. Then the days activities were on top of that. Usually a lot more walking, but some cycle rides.</p>
<p>A physio visit later and the diagnosis was "tendinitis". Treatment: Nothing surprising. Cut the activity levels right down. Cycling is preferable as it's low impact. Only about two or three months to recover. 😦</p>
<p>So, here I am, recovering, <span style="font-weight:900">again</span>. Starting to feel that the idea of walking with a cart is jinxed.</p>

                <p>One of the surprises about my recent holiday was the how interesting walking about the inner west is.</p>
<p>Walkability<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> is one of those concepts that sounds simple, and that you don't notice, until there is a large change, and then suddenly you wonder how you didn't notice it before.</p>
<p>There is a lot of information about walkability. A brief video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4kmDxcfR48">what makes a city great</a>. And more on urban planning.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.walkscore.com/apartments/search/AU-NSW/Sydney">Using this map</a> I have been staying in a <span style="color:Red">Red Zone</span>. Not walkable. My holiday was in a <span style="color:Lime">Green Zone</span>. Very walkable. The difference was eye opening. I'd become habituated to blandness.</p>
<p>Presently, an hour fast walk is about 6km. Most of that is along a busy road. Off that I'm passing cookie cutter style housing. The type were every front yard is manicured to the peer accepted level. There are a couple of cafes along the way near a train station, but otherwise shops are clustered inside a shopping center. Blank boxes, designed to trap you inside, where the layout is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer">confusing and disorentating</a>. Everything planned to encourage you to <a href="https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/everyday-shopping/shopping-centres/articles/shopping-centre-design">buy more</a>.</p>
<p>It's not very interesting walking about the suburbs.</p>
