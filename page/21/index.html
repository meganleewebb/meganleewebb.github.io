<p>Well, it looks like chicken. It's small; not much bigger than a quail. Organic? No way. With all the farms here; pesticides and herbicides abound. Free range? Most definitely.</p>
<p>Fresh. No broken bones. It was in good shape, so I plucked and gutted it.  A wash to get the blood out, and done.</p>
<p>Boiled, with veggies, lentils, fresh peas,  pasta and a touch of curry.</p>
<p>My meat cooking is improving. This was very tender. Almost falling of the bone. Then it was a young bird, and I didn't cook it long.</p>
<p>It gave a slight flavor to the pot, or maybe I imagined that. Not much meat. The breasts had the most, with the legs next. Though not even a mouthful all up. Lots of sucking on bones really.</p>
<p>Was this worth it?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Washing the carcass, knife and hands used 1.5 litres of water. The clean up of the cooking gear used more water than normal to get the oil/fat off.</p>
<p>Two plastic bags to keep it till I cooked it. Both have blood on them, so are now rubbish.</p>
<p>If it was a quail, it would have provided at most 200 calories. Most estimates are less and work on about 100 grams of meat after removing bones. I think I had less than that.</p>
<p>A quarter cup of sultanas is 145 calories.</p>
<p>A tablespoon olive oil is 119 calories.</p>
<p>A tablespoon of peanut butter is around 100 calories (depends on brand, and how heaped the spoon:-)</p>
<p>A medium apple is about 100 calories.</p>
<p>So it's not providing major calories. Not major anything really as its to small to contribute much.</p>
<p>Doing not a lot, the average person needs about 2000 calories a day.  Ten birds and it would make their basal calorie requirements. Exercise, and that increases. I pedal between four to six hours a day. I'd need a whole flock.</p>
<p>Since it was showering here, I'd think no spraying recently, lowering the birds recent pesticide/herbicide intake. If there was a lot of spraying happening, it could have high levels if it was feeding in the sprayed areas. Impossible to know how much your eating.</p>
<p>All up, for the time, effort, water and calories, there are better choices to be had.</p>

<p>After sitting about all day, doing not a lot. I decided not to go to the reserve yet. My hand was quiet sore, red and a bit swollen. I worried that it was getting infected.</p>
<p>By the next day it was clear that it wasn't. So I headed out. Nice day. Top of 31C, warm enough to brave a swim.</p>
<p>Lucky  I did then. Later in the day it clouded over and the temp dropped.. Been quiet nippy since then. Cloudy, showers, wind. Cold snap. Was 2C this morning when I woke, and I was on a hill.</p>
<p>With that sort of weather, I lay about alot. Didn't do much. Watched the the traffic go past.</p>
<p>Worrying sight: father driving 4x4, with daughter(?) sitting on bull bar.</p>

<p>Reluctant to throw things away, I spend a lot of time mending.</p>
<p>My normal task is sewing patches in my pants. They wear just in a few spots at first; where the seat rubs. Later, as the fabric starts to fail, patches sprout all over. Even patches on patches. Until, I have to concede defeat. I try to salvage some of the fabric for patches, but usually it's not worth it. The combination of sun, sweat and dirt is the end of the cloth.</p>
<p>Lately been darning my socks. The heels and the toes wear fastest. Right foot faster than the left, or maybe that sock is older. Not sure. All my socks are black. They don't stay in pairs, so the current right could be newer.</p>
<p>As you can see, my work is functional, with an arty look.</p>

                <p>Well, took three days to get to Wellington. Lots of dirt roads; hills, sand, head scratching. GPS and paper maps didn't agree, and at times neither matched the roads. So did some exploring. Was all fun.</p>
<p>Unlike the angry young man from Binnaway, the young men I met were all very friendly. Guys driving somewhere - stopping to see if I'm okay, or needed anything. That is the way it normally is.</p>
<p>From Wellington, decided to go to Ponto Falls Reserve. GPS shows two routes. One on back roads over a large hill, the other along the highway.</p>
<p>I take the hill.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>I could see the river in the distance. Met a farmer, and yeah, I'm on the wrong side. He showed me the river. Yep. 50m north is where I want to be. To get there is going to be another 40km - back to Wellington and then out on the other route. He lets me camp on his land. Though, just on dusk, after moving my tent twice, I moved out to the road side. His cows kept getting spooked seeing the tent and running around. I didn't think I'd sleep too well with that. Was worried they might walk over me.  But as it happened, I didn't sleep to well anyway.</p>
<p>After dark, all the irrigation pumps started. Fuel motors. Run all night until about 4am. Probably was louder near the river. I was about a kilometer away. Also during the night, I spiked my hand on something sharp under the tent- that wakes you up in a hurry. Can see the puncture marks this morning. Also have needle holes in the tent bathtub to fix sometime. Think it was just dry grass stalks, as didn't find anything spikey under the tent.</p>
<p>So it will be a day of just relaxing in the sun, instead of all the jobs I was going to do.</p>

<p>Just on dawn a small shower drifts in. Just enough to dampen the ground, and the tent. But oh, the smells it brings out. The air is alive with smells; soil, dust, hay, wet blanket (paddock of sheep nearby), and others unidentifiable. Want to keep inhaling, to not miss out.</p>
<p>30km to Dunedoo, 10km to Mendooran. I go to Mendooran. The oldest town for something. But it's a dying town. Cafe closed and for sale, shop for sale, houses for sale. You guess that no one is buying. The helpful NRMA man doesn't know about the road my GPS is suggesting to Wellington. The area is a swamp, could be a fire trail there he says. He suggests an alternative that he knows exists. Off I go, but, another change of plan. Down a dirt road, and then into Dunedoo after all.</p>
<p>Dunedoo surprises me with Neptune. I thought I was done with the solar system.</p>
