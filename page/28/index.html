                <p>Well, woke up and it was -1C with fog. The forecast the the next day was -2C with fog.  Seeing the trend, I decided it was past time to be moving north. Bingara was set to have 5C without fog. All the more reason to shift.  Easy riding, with a nice camp on the river edge.</p>
<p>Then on through Warialda and towards North Star.</p>

<p>The last time I was in in North Star the caravan park had closed. So I camped outside of town. That's now changed and its reopened.</p>

<p>I was recovered from whatever was ailing me previously, but still wasn't making large daily distances. Previous rides through here had longer daylight hours. Winter: the sun rises at 7am, and is gone at 5pm. So I worked out my days to match. Averaged a relaxing 80km a day.  Passed locations of previous camps, and had to find new spots.</p>
<p>Just daily cycling. Empty mind at times. Enjoying the sun, sounds, sights and smells..</p>

                <p>I finished the packet of Shitake mushrooms yesterday. Delicious fungi. Snip the top of the packet, and pour some into my daily stew.  Usually, a packet finishing isn't note worthy, except it signals the end of mushrooms for some time. Small town shops tend not to stock such exotic fare.</p>
<p>Yesterday though, idly waiting for the stew to boil, I was reading the back of the packet:</p>
<p>"Contains desiccant sachet inside.</p>
<p>DO NOT CONSUME"</p>
<p>That sinking feeling... I've not seen that sachet. Fishing frantically through the days stew didn't find it. I'd not seen it on any other days. But I wasn't looking for it then either. Pour in, quick careless stir, lid on till it boils, cool and eat. Not noticed it. What would out look like after a boil? Couldn't have tasted too bad.. Maybe this packet missed out.</p>
<p>Maybe that was why I want feeling the best a few days..</p>
<p>I'll be more careful in future.</p>
<p>-1C this morning with fog. Feeling energetic, so today will continue the pedal north to where it is warmer.</p>

                <p>Left Burning Mountain and slowly made my way north. One of the great things about cycling is that you can talk with a lot of people and this day, I spoke with several; the retired truck driver, clearing the weeds from his driveway with an old hoe, the old man and his son, working to repair their 4x4 on their way up to the Cape,  an retired office worker, enjoying being outdoors.</p>

<p>There was also the climb over the range to get past. I didn't cycle much of it. Was very tired all day, so walked a lot.  But still managed to get into Wallabadah about 2pm.  Another 50km day, into a headwind, and I wasn't feeling that energetic.  At that time I  had the whole camp ground to myself to decide where to set up.  In the end I sheltered in the trees, even though the wind had stopped by sundown.</p>
<p>I woke at midnight to the roar of the wind in the trees, and patter of rain on the tent. Felt glad that I'd chosen the sheltered spot. That was the scene for the day though - wind and lots of it. The rain threatened, but stayed away. I wanted to have another short day, but ended up in Gunnadah. 100km and there was nothing to hide behind. Cotton fields with ankle high grass.</p>
<p>Gunnahah was surprisingly large. I'd expected a smaller town, instead it manages a Coles and Woolworths.  It was basically arrive, find a tent site and sleep. I was exhausted.</p>
<p>The effort to arrive spent me. Heading towards Barraba 80km away, I managed a measly 40k before calling it quits beside the road. Just didn't have the energy to do more that day.  So had a short day, resting in the sun. The wind of the previous day had gone. It seemed a shame to have such a nice day and feel so weak.</p>
<p>The last 40km into Barraba was a struggle.  So, I've decided to rest here a few days to see if I can regain my strength. I'm hoping that now that the course of antibiotics is over things will improve.</p>

                <p>The new Exped tent was horrible. Was kicking myself for not checking it closely after getting it. In the new model, the mesh doors have changed to cloth. I can't see out, and it's warmer, not something I wanted. Needed to change it. Seriously needed to change it. Took a bit of effort, but now I've a MSR Hubba Hubba; the old style; the green one. Mesh doors and I can see out.</p>
<p>In the tent change over time, I saw a Doctor. Thought I had the flu, the nose was sore, but it wasn't like a flu in the sinus. Turns out its not the flu, but an infection inside the nose. On antibiotics that are working really well. I'm wondering why I put up with it for so long! Though, either the infection or the antibiotics are making me really tried. Only managed 50 km today. Will be taking it easy until it's over.</p>
<p>At a nice noisy camp near the highway tonight.Couple more before I find can get on some back roads.</p>
<p>Note: Burning Mountain rest area has toilets, but no drinking water. Fill up in Scone.</p>

                <p>Been a while since I've been through the Watagans. So leaving Sydney I enter again. Its changed a lot since last time. More signage.</p>

<p>These signs are about the camp sites.  Which are a bit funny as there are trees everywhere.</p>
<p>No trees fell on me.</p>
