                <p>It wasn't great waking up. My cold is way worse than before. I really need to rest somewhere. The long day yesterday really knocked me about. Can't stop in Timor though. Asking people what was there when I was in Scone, I was told: a pub, a shop, a corner store. There are a few houses, but the pub and shop have been closed so long the buildings aren't even there. There is an old church, but its closed.</p>
<p>Nundle was 50km and a large climb away. 1.5hours walking up hill. Stopped in Nundle and ate fruit and veges. Rested and then thought I'd try Chaffy Dam. But ended up in Woolomin again. Love the hot chips here. Will rest here a few days and try and get this cold to clear up a bit. Its really knocking me about.</p>
<p>On a good note, no more broken spokes yet. And the wheels had a pounding with all the dirt roads between Scone and Nundle. I had started trying to be like on egg shells, but in the end, just went for it.</p>

                <p>Well the machines stopped about 5ish, but that was just to lul everyone into a false sense of security. I woke up about 2am - what is that noise! They had started up again. With no hope of sleep - I left. A big Hi to Phil, Frazer and Brian, who invited me to their camp. Phil is chasing fish - not any fish. Carp. These are the fish every other fisherman i've met curses and throws out. Phil is only after carp. He's looking for big ones only - up over 20kg would make him really happy.</p>
<p>The road to Musselbrook is not that wide, but has some shoulder. Same for the road to Scone. Not much traffic as you can expect at 3am. A worrying bunch walking along the streets in Mussellbrook when I stopped at the lights. Had me worried for a bit until I could read the signs on their shirts - pest control. Shooting birds as night. I didn't ask what type the rifle was.</p>
<p>Arrived in Scone at 5am. Quiet it was. Just the way I like towns. Coles opened at 6. Got some food and went to find a park.</p>
<p>As expected I broke another spoke. This time I've loosened some of the other spokes. I've tried to get them all the same tension and have the wheel true. Last time the wheel was true, but some spokes felt tighter. Feeling a bit more confident this time. Hoping this is my last one. I'm almost out of spokes.</p>
<p>Wasn't feeling the best so hung out in the park trying to nap. But more road works. When the thumpers started, I new it was time to move on.</p>
<p>Gundy was nice, but with a wedding on, it was going to be busy. Timor was only just down the road lets head there. The road got hilly. I was feeling tired. At 6 i arrived, found a spot and just about to sleep when a car stopped. I'd picked the tennis grounds. And it was tennis night. Didn't matter I fell asleep anyway.</p>

<p>My early start was not to be. 2 km and 'pong'. Another broken spoke.I went back to the tables at Broke and replaced it, then headed to Singleton to get more. Most annoying. I'm expecting at this point to break more:( Time i think to learn wheel building.</p>
<p>The shop in Singleton didn't have spokes or disk pads. The next town with bike shops is Tamworth. I'll be there Monday.</p>
<p>Leaving Singleton was very hot and humid. Stopped at a servo to top up on water, and just as i'm leaving it starts pouring. A before lunch thunder storm.</p>
<p>The road is mostly with a wide shoulder, but every so often one of the blue "watch for bicycles" signs appears. This is when the shoulder shrinks or vanishes. Bummer! Usually its not for long. Though i'm about 20km from Musselbrook and the shoulder isn't to wide now. Lots of traffic here now. Lots of trucks. But so far everyone has been good.</p>
<p>Some water entered my panniers:( I need to roll them more. Luckily the sun is out, and its blowing a gale. I should have everything dry by dark.</p>
<p>I hope that the machinary that is working near by stops tonight, else it'll be earplugs to sleep.  Talking to a local, it has been running 3 days non stop, but it should finish today, but you never know. Lake Liddell supplies 3 power stations. The machinary is putting in new rail tracks.</p>

<p>Finally I'm travelling again. The tooth seems to have healed. It is a bit sore still, but I'm hoping that it will not be a problem.</p>
<p>I stayed with some friends for a week, then left on my usual route. This time was different though - I didn't travel as far as I usually do. Maybe its the effects of the tooth extraction, too much eating, not enough exercise, an immune system upgrade thats underway (I've a cold). Probably its all of them. First day was 30km. Second day was 30km. And  was that a struggle. An hour after starting I was in survival mode: don't think, just pedal, or walk. Only thinking was to pick the next tree/rock/hill to get to.  I didn't go anywhere yesterday. Just sat about a campsite and ate, rested and read books. It was so peaceful where I was, I almost turned around this morning and went back.</p>
<p>After all the weighing up, shaving grams off small items. I left my friends house way over loaded. 8 books was the start of it, "gifts" that I needed to delay sending, the "extra" food that I bought because it was soo cheap, (and I made the mistake of shopping when hungry!). Today was able to post the "gifts" off. 4kg gone. 7 books given away, And by considerable effort, Over 3kg of food eaten. (Well that was over the last 3 days)</p>
<p>The Troll is feeling much lighter now. I'm still carrying a couple of spares that I could get rid of. My Shimano sandals - I've a new pair, but am still wearing the old pair I patched with a cable tie. I've also a spare pair of thongs - still wearing the old pair patched with a cable tie there also. Lets see how long the old ones last..</p>
<p>All my gear should fit in the rear panniers. Having the front ones helps balance the weight about. It also means that any food buys, I have lots of space to carry them. Finding anyting in the bags is also easier.</p>
<p>I'm back in the town of Broke. Dennis doesn't live here any more, so I'm having a peaceful time.</p>
<p>Not many pictures so far. Was stuggling too much, and then just didn't feel like taking any.  Here is one of my Troll.</p>
<p>The frame size is 16" by Surly's measurements. The Norco was an 18.5", but everyone measures differently.</p>

<p>Done. Its out. So far, relatively painless. But I should wait until the anaesthetic has worn off to say that.</p>
<p>There is a flap of bone on the side of the jaw that is fractured that may need to come out. We're hoping that is will heal though.</p>
<p>So, now to rest up and wait for the bleeding to stop.</p>
