                <p>My sleeping bag needs more feathers in it!  Been cold the last few nights. Just below zero, with frosts. Been wearing thermals, clothing, jumper and the rain gear, and it's still cold. My "winter" gloves aren't. My thick socks aren't thick enough. I sleep huddled up like a pill bug, trying new ways to get more layers of my sleeping bag around me.</p>
<p>But after the sun has comes up, it's all forgotten; beautiful sunny, warm days. Who could want for more?</p>
<p>I've managed done dirt roads along the way. The old farmer that stopped told me I was lost. I wanted to believe I wasn't. I had suspected it was going to get interesting when the road became two wheel tracks. But as it as heading the right way, all seemed all good. Later I had to back track and return to the tar. Not bad, a 60km trek about the farm roads. Would have been only 20 km if I'd stayed on the tar.  But where's the adventure in that?</p>

<p>Ah, nothing like the smell of Roundup in the morning. A farmer spraying, and I get a misting as I ride past. No weeds on me!</p>
<p>I take the non direct route to Barraba. It takes a few days. The mining has expanded and the road has been closed permanently. I flag down a mining vehicle, and am told there is an alternative path around the closure. But the driver wasn't sure. The maps I have haven't been updated and provide no help. With no signs to guide me, I return to another route.</p>
<p>Along the way I pass the Rangari automatic telephone exchange. Would have been the heights of modernisation once..</p>

<p>Relaxing dirt roads. Blue sky. A gentle breeze. Next to no traffic. Who could want more?</p>
<p>Packing up next morning I found what looked like a scorpion. Didn't know Australia had any, but we do!</p>

<p>Easy riding mostly. I was heading to Coonabarrabran, but the flat plains and head wind did me in. I turned for a tail wind and flew.</p>
<p>Small towns, slowly dying. Shops closing, buildings for sale. Won't be long before there will be nothing left but a locality sign.</p>
<p>Camping in the bushes I walk through a spiders web. Just were did the spider go?</p>

<p>Another easy day. The sun come out. Time to clean up and dry off. Five days of wet. Been a while since I've had that many in a row I think.</p>
<p>I also wanted to get off the main road. I'll stay a night in the  Quirindi Caravan Park. A hot shower. Been a long time since the last one.</p>
<p>Talked with a lady about horses. She was telling me I should ride a horse rather than pedal. Besides knowing nothing about caring for a horse, I doubt they would make it between water points these days. I was assurred they would as "there's water everywhere".  It amazes me what people believe.</p>
<p>With the clear sky's, the night temperatures have dropped. Riding past the cotton fields, it looked like snow.</p>
