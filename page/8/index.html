                <p>Today, for the first time in over 15 years, I don't own a bicycle. Not just one less, not a temporarily separation but getting back together later, but really none. My beloved Surly Troll, that has been with me on many adventures is gone. It has moved out to a good home. It's going to settling down with a partner of similar attributes. They'll have Sunday rides, raise some kids and go on family adventures.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my paring back is continuing. The tent has been re-seam sealed and is ready to move on. Down sleeping bag went to Vinnies, as will some of my excess clothing. Personal Locator Beacon, deregistered and sold. The Whisperlite International stove and Ortlieb Panniers are off having new adventures. I dare say the stove is seeing a lot more daily use than I ever gave it. After maybe one meal a day, it's probably quite shocked to be doing breakfast, lunch and dinner, with morning and afternoon coffee. A solar panel, water filter, and bunch of other stuff, that a day later I couldn't remember exactly what, and so showed how important it was, is off to another friend. Some other things, worn, but not quite worn out yet, or oh so joyfully discovered in rubbish heaps, or on the side of the road; I've hardened my heart, and placed in the bin.</p>
<p>Yes, in between bouts of procrastination, progress is going really well. I can see the end in sight.</p>
<p>Then, a friend mentioned that I had a bunch of papers at her place.  Twas quite a surprise to me; I'd completely forgotten the old filing cabinet contents from years ago. Given into safe keeping, but perhaps it was more "I really want to get cycling now, and don't want to deal with this - can you hold it. I'll be back for it soon." Six and a half years later, I'm dealing with it. The folders where chockablock

. Thankfully with the passage of time, most of it can easily be binned; decade old receipts; from which I learn't that things cost a lot less than today, airline tickets and boarding passes, hotel brochures and old photos of parties, in which I was very happy and very cheerful with lots of people whom I haven't a clue who they are now. Stuff that seemed terribly important at the time and needed to be kept, now quickly moves to the trash.  Some papers are more troubling; the "official records". Some I bin. High school and university semester results, certificates of attainment and old tax and banking records. But others, while I wanted to bin them, confident that in this day and age, no one requires paper, the reality isn't so simple. True, some institutions have moved with the times, and will accept electronic copies. But perplexingly, others really do want that piece of paper that looks like it come out of an 80's dot matrix printer with a blurry and fading stamp on it. And if you don't have
_ their _
piece of paper, you're in for a lot of time, hassle and expense to get a new one, or come up with an alternative. I wonder if a new one would still look the same? Still considering if this really needs to be kept. Or if, at this time of my life, that I'm not likely to need it any more.</p>
<p>Not to stop with just physical stuff downsizing, I'm also culling and organising my digital world. The free storage offers, have just encouraged keeping files, purely for the sake of keeping. Like the cupboards in the house, that you hide stuff away in to not think about, so it goes online. But I'm onto it.</p>
<p>Music files got deleted. The tracks that were so truly awful that you can't bear to even hear them; they went years ago, but others that aren't that bad, but by the same measure, aren't that good either. Been holding on to them as 'they might grow on you'. Deleted them. If they haven't grown on me by now, they're not going to in the future. Without them, I they will not have the chance to grow on me, so that solves that. Can't miss what you don't have.</p>
<p>The ebook collection lost hundreds of titles by the simple measure of 'might I read this?'. For a surprising amount of books - no. I've been guilty of hoarding
<a href="https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=free%20books">free books</a>
, or falling for the "collection sale on now" tactics. You know, where you buy 10 books for less than the price of one, to get that one book you might, perhaps one day, if you've nothing else, maybe like to read, and nine others that are absolute rubbish, that no one wanted and they never sold. So bundling them in as a collection is the only way to move them.</p>
<p>Photos fortunately wasn't a much of a cull - I already have a small collection there. I still recognise all the people. Better keep them.</p>
<p>And so it continues. Still trawling through the records digitised when I started on the road. Like the filing cabinet folders, there is sure to be plenty in there to bin.</p>
<p>There's something satisfying about cleaning up, having less. A sense of achievement. Nothing lurking in the corners, or hidden way, forgotten or undealt with. Knowing exactly what you own.  A feeling of freedom.  Go on, give it a try.</p>

                <p>Was a tough trip. Basic route was Southern Highlands then out to Oberon and back into Lithgow. The weather was kind - only a bit of rain, and small amount of hail. Few hot days, but mostly very pleasant. Lots of great camping was enjoyed. Bit hilly in places. Managed 93 km/hr on one downhill. Of course every downhill has an up. The slow climbs gave lots of time to admire the scenery.</p>
<p>With the return to Sydney, back into planning and action. The first step has been taken; my Surly Troll has been listed for sale on

<p>No sooner was the last blog posted, when plans developed for a trip about the southern highlands. Back on the bike again. So far, have spent ten days making 45km as the crow flies. Lots of strength sapping 30km days. Then resting in the shade of a gum tree. Not anyone could do it.</p>

<figcaption>where I'm walking</figcaption>

<p>During the recent cycling I was doing a lot of thinking. I'm going to try a change; and not cycle to Cairns next year to see family. I'll travel there some other way- bus, train, or plane. I've cycled the route enough times now that the trip is becoming a drudge. Especially the section between Clermont and Charters Towers. It's worse when I leave it too late to head south and it's hot. Also, I want to go some places I can't take the bike.  A fair amount of my gear needs replacing at the moment. Since I need to replace stuff, the plan is to lighten and shrink up my gear load to fit in a backpack. I'd like to try walking for a bit. It will take a while to do this, as I haven't walked much in years. Why walk when I can cycle? The most I have walked is inside Woolies or Coles shopping; my walking muscles have wasted away. I need to build them up again.</p>
<p>Each day I do some walking exercise. At first my feet, ankles and calves ached terribly. I needed days of rest to recover. But it's improving. Soon as I can travel a reasonable distance repeatedly, I'll start adding weight to my pack. Then it will be short trips to check how it goes.</p>
<p>Lightening the load will have benefits even if I end up not walking.  My current bike gear weight is over 30kg and it all "seems essential". Even after taking out the bicycle specific items, what's left is heavier than I want to backpack. My aim is to get the weight down to less than 15kg, preferably less than 10kg.  That is the base weight:  the pack and everything in it, except food, water and fuel.</p>
<p>Obviously some hard choices will have to be made to achieve that.</p>

                <p>Felt like a long commute heading south this time: Wake in the dark to beat flies, pack up, cycling before sun up. Stop for breakfast early, in the shade. Cycle. Snack. Drink. Cycle. Enter a town. Buy food if needed, fill up with water, cycle out. Look for the perfect sleep spot; the Hilton 5 star spot - an easy wheel off the road to get to, flat ground, no road noise, no animal trails, no high grass, soft leafy ground cover, no thorns, secluded, shade, no tall trees that could drop branches, no dead trees that could fall over, water near by, bushes to block high winds, but still allow a cool breeze off the water, no flies, mosquitoes, ants, ticks, or spiders. Get tired and settle on a "good enough" - none of those, but will be shady when the sun goes down in another few hours. Decide which is better: hotter sitting in the tent in the sun out of the flies, or standing in some partial shade and wave the flies away. Stand and wave the flies away. Eventually the sun sinks enough that the tent is in the shade, climb in, chase the flies out and eat a cold dinner in peace. Sun sets, stretch the leg muscles, sleep, to wake up and do it all over again.</p>
<p>A few variations: I stopped in Barraba for a day to visit friends and wash. Managed a 150km day after that, mainly because the planned stop had no shade at all, it was still early in the day and Wallabadah was <strong>only</strong> 70km away - how hard could it be? Six hours later, I could answer that. But all I remember now is how great it felt to get there. It was one of the rare days when I carried minimal water, because the towns are close, so I had to get there.</p>
<p>Rear tire was a bit soft a couple of days. Add air to fix. It got worse. Finally got tired of just added air each time, so checked it out. The rusty nail was a suspicious. Pulled it out and yep, that's the air leak. Fixing it took less time than all the time I'd spend putting air in.  Leave the wheel on the bike, pop the tire off the rim, pull the tube out, patch, push it back in the tire, reset the tire, add air. Done.</p>
<p>Scone - decided not to stay between the main road and the coal train line. So caught the train down to Sydney. Surprisingly with night trackwork, and busses replacing trains, the bus driver let me on the bus. Might had been because at 11pm there was not a lot of people wanting to get on - four of us on that bus. Back on the train again, and got off in Hornsby to start riding. Halfway to my sleep spot it started raining. I pondered how all the way down from Cairns with one brief thunderstorm overnight and I get rained on now 30 minutes from stopping. In bed at 2am slightly damp.</p>
<p>So now in Sydney again and surprisingly cold! Had two warmer days, but I'm in thermals/jumper most of the time. Feels like a Chinese curse - may you get what you wish for. I wanted cooler, I got it.</p>
