                <p>At the Bidjar Ngoulin hut, on the way to Collie, i decided that I was over the Munda Biddi trail. Number of reasons. It was increasingly like a tunnel under the trees. It was cold and damp. And probably the most important one: I was tired of following those little markers. While there were less trails to get lost on as the Munda Biddi progressed, there where many times when I was lost, and had to back track. Other times wondering if I was on the right trail, as it had been a while since I'd seen the. marker.  The mining and logging diversions also was annoying. There was another near the hut that I would encounter if I continued.  So, after looking a the map, I returned to Dwellingup and headed west.  I immediately felt much better about the trip. Also got away from the set routine of making the next camp site.  This is my time to pick a point. The info for the Munda Biddi says the purpose built campsites are an easy day apart. They are not. There are other campsites you must use, that don't have the hut and water tanks.  All up the ride was good. I was told that further south it opens up a lot more and isn't so hilly. Maybe next time I'm back over this way I'll try again. I do think that the time I was riding it isn't the best. It was dark, cold and damp a lot of the time. Anyway, I'm off it and heading east. And a town i just had to visit was Wandering. Not that there was a lot there. Even the post office was getting renovations so wasn't open. The caravan park was shut for the long weekend. But still, it was a good ride.</p>

                <p>Dwellingup was a nice little town. Though getting to it as damp. I passed the POW camp, but it was showering at the time.</p>

<p>This guy at the information center looked how i felt at the time. Still, heading out towards Collie, the trail was nice and easy for a while.</p>

</a></p>
<p>With all the modern cons. The local area is now big on mining, but it orginally was logging. There is still logging today though. I stopped and saw King Jarrah. Looked a lot like this tree:</p>

<p>But standing upright. It also had green leaves, the bark was alive.. Okay, not a lot like that one. The one above is called "Whim". I didn't find out why. It was 600years old when they cut it down and mounted it in the park.</p>

                <p>Well, the time has finaly come. I'm off.</p>

<p>Fairwell to Perth and heading out into the great outdoors. It has been good being in Perth, though it feels like the place that you visit and end up staying years and years. Its been almost a year since I arrived.  The Mundi Biddi is on again. The first day was an easy ride. The second a bit more of an effort. Still with plenty of time to look about and admire the scenery.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Other times its been more of a challenge, with lots of time to puff and pant up and down the hills. Time to get the legs back into shape.  Seems the only part of me that was getting any exercise in Perth was my waistline. I'm sure that will change soon though. In the mean time, the trail is calling..</p>

<p>Sorry for the changes. I worked on a different method of sending in my blog posts. But gremlins struck. First post from the trail and it didn't work. Testing a bit more, fixed the problem. (I hope).</p>

                <p>Still in Perth, house sitting for another week. Time enough to finish this article that I'd been thinking about for a long time.</p>
<p>While travelling solo by bicycle, I’m often asked: “Aren’t you afraid?”  My answer is:”No”, but, if feeling social, followed with “Afraid of what?”</p>
<p>Sometimes I get the vague “something happening”, but more often it’s a definite “someone like ...” :Ivan Milat, Peter Falconio or The Kimberly Killer.</p>
<p>My arguments that they’re examples that didn't target bicycle riders and that psychotic killers live in cities seldom sway.  They’re just not convinced.</p>
<p>After one such question, I resolved to track down just how much of a risk it is from the mad killer, so I could give a more accurate and informed counter response.  Maybe with hard numbers on my side it would make a difference.</p>
<p>After looking at the numbers, a fairer response might be “Why aren’t you afraid?”  While, not to deny that bad things can happen, and that a certain amount of personal responsibility is needed,  the odds are overwhelming in favour of a lifetime of happy, safe and uneventful (from foul play) bicycle touring trips.</p>
<p>In case you're not familiar with the above examples offered:</p>
<p>Ivan Milat,  perhaps the most infamous, having drawn international attention for killing seven (five international tourists, two locals)  in the early 1990’s.  He targeted hitch-hiking backpackers. Stopped, offered lifts, and once he had them in his vehicle, proceeded to attack.</p>
<p>Peter Falconio, a British tourist, is an odd one to be afraid of. I presume the fear is that something similar will occur. Peter is listed as presumed dead, following foul play in 2001 after the car he was a passenger in stopped late one night on the Stuart highway.</p>
<p>The Kimberly Killer, only heard from elderly retirees, was a case I wasn’t initially familiar with. Back in 1986, Joseph Schwab, a German tourist, flew to Australia, and killed five people for reasons unknown, before being killed himself by police.</p>
<p>None of them were targeting bicycle tourists. Though, the Kimberly Killer most meets the criteria of random killing of strangers. Someone, who if you met at the time, it would not be your lucky day. But one case, 27 years ago, is a long time ago to still be worried about it occurring today. Not a very good  reason to hold back from going for a bike ride.</p>
<p>While the cases above made the news because of their international links, doubtless there are other homicides each year that don’t make the popular press.  So to get an idea of how risky death by homicide is, we need to know who is being killed, how many people are killed each year, and  where are they killed.  Fortunately, all this information is freely available on the web.</p>
<p>Looking at the Australian Institute of Criminology,</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide/victim-offender.aspx" >
Homicide Victim-offender relationship stats 2006-7 </a></p>
<p>we find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>36% - Friends/acquaintances<br>
15% - Family<br>
13% - Other   (Includes work colleagues, employee/employer, former employee/employer, gang members, and former gang members)<br>
10% - Intimates<br>
25% - Strangers<br>
2% - Unknown<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’re far more likely to be killed by someone you know than a total stranger. In 74% of homicides, the victim knew their killer.</p>
<p>But it's worse if you’re female. Take the guys out of the mix and people you know account for 94% of homicides.</p>
<p>Female victim and offender relationship</p>
<blockquote>
<p>53% - intimates <br>
21% - family<br>
16% - friends/acquaintances<br>
6% - strangers<br>
4% - other (Includes work colleagues, employee/employer, former employee/employer, gang members, and former gang members)<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who said having a partner was good for safety?</p>
<p>Just to continue on to kids;</p>
<p>Child victim and offender relationship</p>
<blockquote>
<p>69% - custodial parent<br>
15% - non custodial parent<br>
8% - Acquaintance<br>
4% - close friend<br>
4% - other relationship<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stranger doesn’t even make a significant category.</p>
<p>As you would expect, when family, friends and other people you know are trying to kill you. Where do they succeed:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide/location.aspx" >Location of Homicide</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>61% - residential<br>
24% - street/footpath<br>
13% - other<br>
2% - unknown<br></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You feeling safe at home?  With family, partner, or friends?</p>
<p>Keeping it in perspective:</p>
<p>The number of Australian homicides in 2006-7 was: 298.   Of that, 60 homicides were by strangers: 60 homicides out of 21 million Australians.</p>
<p>And contrary to what it might seem like from the media, the number of homicides has been in <a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.aspx" >decline since 1989</a>, while the Australian population grew.</p>
<p>Low risk.</p>
<p>Consider that the death rate from <a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.aspx">homicides in 2006-07 was 1.3 per 100,000 people</a>, while <a href="http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/safety/publications/2009/pdf/rsr_04.pdf">
Road deaths in 2007-08 was 6.9 per 100,000</a></p>
<p>Afraid to be on the road? You're much more likely to be a road fatality then a homicide victim.</p>
<p>For more numbers and higher risk ratings, head over to the Australian Bureau of Statistics:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3303.0">Causes of Death in Australia</a></p>
<p>And have a browse.   In 2010, the leading cause of death was Ischaemic heart disease: 21,708  followed by Cerebrovascular diseases: 11,204.</p>
<p>(Interesting:  Prostate cancer 3235,  Breast cancer 2864.  Prostates are getting the bottom end of publicity compared to breasts.)</p>
<p>With the top killers, the risk can be reduced by healthy eating and exercise.</p>
<p>I’m not afraid. Rather than being afraid of a low risk event (homicide),  pay attention to what has a higher risk status (health) and can be influenced.</p>

<p>Just back in Perth after a few days cycle along the
<a href="http://www.mundabiddi.org.au/">
Munda Biddi Trail
</a>
.  The plan was to take a jaunt down south, then loop back into Perth for a final pack up before leaving Perth this year.  It didn't work out so well.</p>
<p>The Mundi Biddi trail is really well marked.  However, there are a number of other trails in the area that cross or travel along with the Mundi Biddi. Some are: Heritage Trail, Bibbulmun Track, Kep Track, Kalamanda Track.  Some are cycle use only, others walker use only, some mixed use.</p>
<p>They all use triangle shaped markers.</p>
<p>I was really poor at watching for the markers, and even when I noticed a trail marker, I was slack at noticing the difference between the markers.  I'm sure that I rode or walked every track in the area at one time or another.  There was lots of back tracking.  With a loaded touring bike, this was slow going. There were many times when I didn't ride due to a reluctance to bounce my bike and panniers over the bumps.</p>
<p>On the first section, I managed to clock up just over 75km to cover the 42km marked track between the sites.  I did improve, but still managed to get off trail a few times each day.  Still riding along in the bush is so blissful. Part of my problem with missing the markers.</p>
<p>After arriving in Perth to fine cool weather, the first day back riding it warmed up and started showering. I was soon sweating like a cracked fish tank.  Any fitness from cycling into Perth has long since vanished. Pushing up and down trails was a full body workout. I slept well.</p>
<p>Since I was planning to return to Perth, I'd left gear behind. Unfortunately, I had left the stove repair kit behind. While the stove has been running for years without any problems, I do (normally) carry the repair kit for it, in case of problems when well away from the shops. One small rubber seal had hardened with age and was leaking fuel, making stove use risky.  While I'd ridden Sydney to Cairns without a stove, I wasn't looking forward to doing that again, so returned to Perth.</p>
<p>Now to clean up my gear left in Perth and head out again.</p>
