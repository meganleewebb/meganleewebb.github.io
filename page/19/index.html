<p>It was a slow trip to Hill End.

, meant it wasn't going to be flat easy pedaling.</p>
<p>Maybe the trip too Orange would be better.</p>
<p>I chose the Dixon Long Point track. 4 wheel drive only, with a river crossing 20 km from the start. Okay, it wasn't easy pedaling either. But it did delivered on views and low traffic.</p>
<p>An unknown was how deep the water crossing would be. I'd been told everything from bone dry, to waist deep. With the daily storms, it seemed no one knew.</p>
<p>Only ankle deep.</p>

<p>A very early start out of Sydney. Hot, humid and hilly, but I've a grin from ear to ear. It's good to be out cycling again.</p>

<p>Was in a ride state by the Sunday, but then I spent four days working on a new chain case. The old one was white core-flute, the new is black polypropylene(?); from a discarded A0 art folio. It is thinner, as stiff as core-flute, and holds its shape better.  I have plans for more improvements, but, next year.</p>
<p>The clean and shiny look won't last long. I am returning to where I left off. The forecast for the next week; daily showers and thunderstorms.</p>

                <p>Wow! That was a fast delivery!
<a href="http://www.surlybikes.com/">Surly</a>
shipped it express! How's that for service! I'm still blown away with how wonderful they have been to me.</p>
<p>I got the call yesterday morning, but had things happening, so couldn't get down until this morning.</p>
<p>Sleepless night.</p>
<p>By 9:30 I was waiting outside.
Cheeky Transport <sup><a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> for http://www.cheekytransport.com.au</sup>
opens at 10:00.  I didn't want to be late.</p>
<p>Time slows when your waiting. But of course, it does pass.</p>

<p>Quick check and drool, then Donny got to work. Faced off the headset and bottom shell and cleaned the threads. Didn't fit the bottom bracket yet, but did fit the head set cups. Also did a quick check of the rear drop-outs for alignment; they are perfect. Then it was off to get some supplies before that first feed.  Lots of time to admire the paint, welds, braze-ons and stickers. Lots more braze-ons now!</p>
<p>It's been a warm day, just right for what I had planned:
<a href="http://surlybikes.com/info_hole/spew/spew_care_and_feeding_of_your_steel_frame">Care and feeding of your new frame</a>
.</p>
<p>She's now sitting in the kitchen on newspaper, oozing. Luckily I'm here alone, else I've a feeling we'd both be out in the garden shed. Feeding was messy. We both got covered. I won't need to moisturise tonight.
<a href="http://www.whiteknightpaints.com.au/specialty-paints/metal/rust-guard/prep/fish-oil">White Knight Rust Guard Fish Oil</a>
isn't as fishy as it could be, but its not completely odourless.  Maybe when it dries a bit more.  Just need to shoo the neighbourhood cats away until then.</p>
<p>There are a lot of rust preventative products about. But, think of this: fish swim in the sea all day, and they don't rust.</p>
<p>Well, sheep don't rust either, but the hardware didn't have Lanolin, so fish oil it was.</p>
<p>It's gone 36C here today, so so maybe she will be dry by morning for assembly.</p>

                <p>Been a while since I've been to Sculpture by the Sea. Got there early to try and avoid the crowds, but lots of other people had the same idea. Also forgot that early is when the joggers are out in force.</p>
<p>Of the sculptures, I liked these ants best:</p>

</a></p>
<p>But then, I like ants.</p>
<p>There were a couple of other interesting sculptures.  But of the remainder, some wouldn't have been out of place in a playground. And some, you would have walked over them if they weren't fenced off with a little plaque telling you it was a sculpture.</p>
<p>I left thinking that overall, it was less than average. That this year, Sculpture by the Sea was relying more on the location for impressive than the sculptures.</p>
