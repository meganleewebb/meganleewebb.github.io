                <p>Felt much better when I woke. Peaceful ride into Walbundarie. It's larger than I was expecting. I'm ravenous, eat my breakfast, quarter of a watermelon, a loaf of fruit bread and a handful of cashew nuts. Still I'm hungry, but decide to leave. Better to be a bit hungry than stuffed full.</p>
<p>A tail wind leaving, and it is good, until it moves to a cross wind, and strengthens.</p>
<p>I'm walking. The wind is roaring. Black clouds grow. I head down a narrow dirt track to get to a parallel road. But riding is impossible. Even walking is difficult. Just as rain drops hit, I find a bush to hide behind. There are other trees about, but none I trust to shelter under.</p>
<p>I watch the storm pass. Not enough rain to wet me. But the wind continues. Eventually I decide to find better shelter. More walking.</p>
<p>An hour later, I find it. A stand of Casuarina trees. I wait in vain for the wind to drop. Dust clouds are whipped up.</p>
<p>I watch the fire brigade speed past, and look anxiously for a fire. Impossible to tell with the dust. No smell of smoke.</p>
<p>As darkness falls, I'm not going anywhere. Still too windy.  A couple hours later it eases.</p>
<p>Next morning, in Walbundarie, I learn the fire was at Rand. But it's out now.</p>
<p>Rand, when I arrive it's a ghost town. Or maybe aliens have abducted everyone. I stop for lunch. Then riding around the town, still see no one. Slightly spooky. I head off towards Urana.</p>
<p>Later I see a ute driving up and down in a paddock. Is this what country people do instead of driving round and round the block? Nope, Jay is doing EM Mapping. Up and back, 30 meters apart, for the whole field, dragging the sensor. He tells me of fields that are 8km in length. Long uneventful days, just driving up and back. I guess it is a job that drones will replace in the future.</p>

<p>Old car, still used every day in Holbrook.</p>
<p>I stop for lunch, restock with food and water then leave.</p>
<p>Hannah, an older lady, not as spry on her legs as she once was, comes over to talk with me. When she was 18 she rode her bicycle through Sweden and Germany. Her eyes sparkled remembering the times.</p>
<p>On the way toward Culcairn, I'm not feeling the best. The helpings of roadside plums probably didn't help. I stop early. My stomach rolling, and dig several cat holes. By the time darkness falls, I've used them up. Thankfully, I fall asleep without further problems.</p>

<p>A spectacular sunrise over the valley.</p>
<p>On the road into Holbrook, I'm walking. The slope was gentle and I should be riding, but the energy wasn't flowing. I stumble along slowly.</p>
<p>A motorcycle passes, slows, turns around and returns. John was on his way to work, and wondered if I had mechanical problems. We talk for an hour about bicycles, bush, to many cars, the climate of fear in Australia and the country life.</p>

<p>Christmas has come! Crunchy peanut butter marked way down. Okay, expiry it's listed as 3rd Jan 2015. As if that matters. It won't last that long! I get the last two jars.</p>
<p>Manfred, on holidays from German invites me to have a coffee with him. We have a wonderful chat about life, holidays and the beauty of nature.</p>
<p>Back roads towards Holbrook. A farmer stops to see if I'm lost. As he says "don't see many of your type out here". I think he was meaning the bike.</p>
<p>I pass an old church in a sea of yellow. Then spend another peaceful night in the pine forest.</p>

                <p>Or Tumba, as Australians shorten it to. Took the slow road from Batlow. Weaved about the logging roads, avoiding the showers and storms, and feed the mossies. Also avoided the dropping branches. Unlike the the park in Batlow, I did see branches falling.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first fine sunny day in a while.  Was cool and windy, so I sat in the sun, read and knitted. Was near a rural fire building at first. But people stopped to ask if I was breaking in. What sort of question is that?  Would a thief have answered "yes"? Did my "no" convince them? I noticed other drivers slowing down and looking my way. I didn't like the attention, so moved on up the road out of sight.</p>
