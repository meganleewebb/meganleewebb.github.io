<p>This is the view from my breakfast spot. No, its not where I slept. Though I'll need to find a new spot for tonight. Got woken up about midnight by the security guards wanting to see identification and know what I was doing. I thought that was obvious -  sleeping! Reckon I might not get away with it there again tonight.</p>
<p>Apart from the midnight wake up, a good nights sleep was had. Even found a spot to charge my phone. Now if they just had free wifi it would be almost perfect. (Perfect would be no security guards waking you up, and free wifi.)</p>
<p>Worryingly, the tooth is hurting more than yesterday.  I'm wondering if this is just all the pain killers draining out of my system. Still on antibiotics, another few days left of that course. Will see how the pain develops today if at all, and go see the regular dentist again for an appointment to pull it out. Well, still wavering on root canal or pull out. More leaning to pull it out. Both have consequences and risk factors.</p>
<p>Still feels like too much gear on the bike, even though I ditched stuff and got lighter stuff. Though, putting the tent on the back rack with the panniers and water isn't as bad as I thought for front wheel lift. Thinking about a basket on the platform on the front rack. Would be a handy place to drop the shopping, and commonly used items for the day.</p>

<p>I'd been staying with friends. It was terribly nice of them, but  decided today, time to move on. Because of unresolved  tooth issues, and waiting for front wheel bearing replacement, I need to stay about Sydney for a bit.  Options on the tooth are extract it or root canal and crown.</p>
<p>While thinking about that, did lots on the bike. A rear Tubus Cosmo rack can be mounted as a front rack. This is great as it has a platform and is light; about 700gms.</p>
<p>Made up a bracket to mount the light above the front rack load. Need to get the wheel back to see how good this works.</p>
<p>Some photos of the bike when I stopped in the park for a repack.</p>
<p>Surly isn't as rigid as the Yuba. First ride fully loaded was almost like a piece of noodle - cooked, not raw. But this turned out to be the load not firmly fastened. With everything tied down good, it still has some flex, but handles fine.</p>
<p>Now to sort out somewhere to sleep.</p>

<p>Just what is the evolutionary advantage to having pain receptors in your teeth?</p>
<p>I survived the weekend. But it wasn't easy, or something I'd like to do again. I was sitting at the door to the dentists this morning before 8am waiting to see if I could get for an apointment. I was contemplating using pliers myself. The pain was agonyising. No matter how much I told myself pain isn't real, breath, think of something else - it didn't work. Drugs helped I think, but not enough. What did people do before Dentists and pain medication? (I suspect the pliers).</p>
<p>Forget about worrying which tooth it was, I wanted them all out. Nothing so drastic yet, the suspect from last week did have a crack in it.</p>
<p>At the moment, the pain continues, but wether nerve death, drugs or plain exhaustion its a bit less than the weekends levels. I'm told that it continue to go down now and in a couple of days not hurt at all.</p>
<p>I can't wait.</p>

<p>Thank you. Glad your liking the site.  I also wonder how we managed. I recall my first long cycle - around Tasmania, I didn't have any gadgets. Contact with anyone was send a postcard, or phone a public phone box with a bundle of coins.</p>

<p>Todays problems:</p>
<p>Broken spoke on rear wheel. Not had this in years. Hoping it is just a weak spoke.</p>
<p>Hebie Stabilizer fell apart - well more so than it had before. There was a cosmetic bit of plastic tubing that covered the spring and attachment points - that fell off before the first photo was taken. This time the spring fell off when the clamp became loose.</p>
<p>The stablizer keeps the front wheel pointing forward when you lean your bike against a post, or put the bike on a center stand.  For me, it also stops the front light I have mounted at the top of the fork, being bashed against the frame. I had one on the Yuba, till my spring broke. (I got a spring from the hardware store. Yuba sell a spring, that is probably way better suited than the one I used.) The Yuba has a drilled mounting point on the down tube.  The Hebie uses a "one size fits all" clamp. It was good while it worked. It looks like the strap that goes around the down tube slipped when the plastic coating softened. I know we have had some hot weather here lately, but was it that hot?</p>
<p>I removed it as there didn't seem to be much point keeping it on. Looking at how the clamp works, I'm not impressed.  Its also marked the paint:(</p>
<p>At this time I wouldn't recommend buying a Hebie Stabilizer.</p>
<p>Later I found the spring! That was a bit of luck. So have it on with a cable tie for now. And I cable tied one end of the spring on so that it cannot fall off and get lost again. The cable tie will not be a long term solution. If I keep this, then I'll be looking for a better clamp. Means I'll be making my own up. If I do that, I'd go to all stainless steel or aluminium fittings so they don't rust.</p>
<p>I'll wait until I have my front rack fitted, because then I'll be moving the light to another location. Stopping the light getting hit was my main reason for fitting the stabilizer. On the Yuba I had a piece of water pipe around the light to protect it.  The light is plastic - repeated hits on the frame would not be good for its long term health. I like my light, so am looking out for it. I keep a sock on it during the day to reduce UV exposure also.</p>

<p>Was heading back to where I'm staying, via some of the dumpsters I've visited in the past. Being away, places have shut down and of course new places have opened. Its not the best area, but sometimes you get lucky. Today was one of those days.</p>
<p>Ended up with  9 loaves of bread, and some buns. Cause I wasn't going to eat that much so spent most of the afternoon finding people to give bread to.  Was looking for people begging, or in need. Some beggers didn't want food, only money.  Gave away all that I didn't want  in the end.</p>
<p>Wasn't actually looking for food though. Was looking for some stainless steel to make a bracket for my front rack. I'm going to mount a rear Tubus Cosmo rack on the front.  My plan needs a small U shaped bracket. I want this to be stainless steel.  Didn't find any this time. I did pick up a handful of milling and lathe bits from one skip outside a house in the suburbs. Going to find someone to give them to tomorrow.</p>
<p>Also gathered up some clothes and dropped them in to one of the church charity bins.</p>
<p>Feeling happy with the day. Nothing like digging around in bins, and giving stuff away.</p>
