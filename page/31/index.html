                <p>Still in Sydney, been stretching my legs, walking about. Also been enjoying fruit that you are unlikely to find in the country:</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/1-fruit-IMG_0908.jpg" >
<img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/1-fruit-IMG_0908.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian">Durian</a>
, reckoned by some as the "king of fruits". Not sure if I'd go that far, but it is definitely delicious.  (Had to check for the "queen of fruits"; the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_mangosteen">mangosteen</a>
.  They fruit about the same time.) I'm lucky that I find them pleasant smelling. Other people aren't so lucky. In Asia, some hotels and public transport ban them. I ate mine outside, sitting in the garden.</p>
<p>Walking about town isn't the same as out bush, so headed for a walk down in "The Royal".</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/3-cave-IMG_0914.jpg" >
<img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/3-cave-IMG_0914.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Looking on the
<a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/region.aspx?name=Sydney-region">National Parks website</a>
, the walk I did is listed as the
<a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/royal-national-park/karloo-walking-track/walking">Karloo</a>
and
<a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/royal-national-park/uloola-walking-track/walking">Uloola</a>
walking tracks.  They have the distance for Uloola listed as 10km, but is more like 5. Another site list
<a href="http://short-walks.com.au/new-south-wales/sydney/uloola-track-heathcote-to-waterfall/">Uloola</a>
as going from Heathcote to Waterfall which would be about 10km. So there is a bit of confusion there on naming or distance. The National Parks rate both as "medium difficulty". I rate it (Heathcote to Waterfall) as an
<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bludge">bludge</a>
walk.</p>
<p>Was disappointed at the the state of Karloo Pool. Looked like some people had camped or partied there - so smashed beer bottles, half burnt plastic and trash left behind.</p>
<p>While sitting about at Uloola Falls, a couple of joggers turned up. One guy surprised me by drinking from the stream. He reckoned it tasted "just like water". Not sure what that means - as pure water is tasteless. That water was certainly not pure. And while the water looks clear, I wouldn't trust drinking it - especially in the Royal! Clear flowing water is not safe to drink. The bugs that cause illness are tiny - you can't see them.  His mate didn't seem keen on him drinking it either.</p>

<p>Riding along a stretch of the bike path, I notice the trees have yellow strips painted on their trunks. Looking across the canal,  I think their days are numbered.</p>
<p>Hunting about online, I found it is part of work Sydney Water is doing for a Cooks River remediation project -
<a href="http://www.sydneywaternews.com.au/2013/08/20/working-together-to-restore-the-cooks-river/">http://www.sydneywaternews.com.au/2013/08/20/working-together-to-restore-the-cooks-river/</a>
Along with replacing the steep concrete sides with a more natural rock bank, the non native willow trees will be replaced with natives.</p>
<p>So, definitely progress :)</p>

<p>I does look good but it would surely be better if they found a way to retain the trees. In this expedient days trees are often seen as easily replaceable and in a local blinkered view they are. The trouble starts as we widen our view and realise that each one of these was probably 20 years old and somewhere  else out of our view another similar tree has just been yanked out and transplanted. The result is still a 50% loss ie we could have had two trees absorbing carbon, providing habitat and soon there will only be one. :(</p>

<p>Went back recently and there is a sign up explaining the tree removal. So I wasn't the only one wondering. Yes some of the non natives are being removed, but they claim 80,000 natives will be planted to replace them.  I wondered how they counted them all..</p>

                <p>After leaving Far North Queensland, I decided to travel back to Barraba for a bit. Arriving in town on Thursday morning, I walked about asking if anyone knew of any volunteer, casual or part-time jobs going. Well, within the space of an hour, I was hired.</p>
<p>It was to have been an easy casual position: waitress/kitchen-hand. But that quickly changed and I found myself with the title 'Manager', planning, directing staff, and making changes.  Looking back on the time now, it was fun and exciting. Long hours but ultimately rewarding.</p>
<p>I was only to have been working for a couple weeks, but ended up extending my time to a couple of months.</p>
<p>If your ever travelling up near Barraba, phone up and book a lunch, or stay at The Playhouse Hotel
<a href="http://www.playhousehotel.com">http://www.playhousehotel.com/</a></p>

                <p>After missing the cooler weather down south, I traveled south. And got cooler weather in abundance.</p>
<p><a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/1-IMG_0850.jpg" >

<p>-8C  Definitely cooler.  Found lots of exciting things: throwing water on the windscreen was a bad idea - it just froze and just made the ice layer thicker.  Wiper blades froze onto the windscreen and don't move. The water washer also froze. Ice is very abrasive - I now need new windscreen wipers..</p>
<p>The taps outside froze solid - so check for running water before taking off your clothes for a shower.  My van is unheated - so stuff inside froze also.   More than one blanket was needed.  Getting up and running to the shower block in thongs was guaranteed to give you frozen feet before you arrived.  Leaving the shower, wet hair froze on the run back.</p>
<p>Was an interesting experience.  One that I'm not that keen to repeat.</p>

<p>I like cool times, but sub zero temperatures - I just don't have the gear for enjoying it.</p>
