<p>Restless restless. A restlessness of the spirit. Left Barraba at 6. Bingera was a food stop - baked beans, scotch finger biscuits and a carrot. I watched the guy fugitively filling the rubbish bins in the park from the bags in his car.</p>
<p>Warialda - more baked beans. The information center had no maps. Sights I'd seen before apear like familiar signs. Tall silver metal silos, the turn off to North Star. A broken letter box - the end of the long flat straight, the start of the hills. Rolling hills disappearing upwards- lots of walking time.</p>
<p>190km after starting, I was no longer restless.</p>

                <p>Didn't sleep well. Wanting to get up early to get into Tamworth early I think. Left Woolomin at 4:00. The road in has no shoulder til about 6km out, when the truck traffic started - even at 5am.</p>
<p>Only surprise was one house where the dogs barked - a small white yappy rat like thing run out. I ignored that and just cruised along. But then there was a deeper bark and noise of a bigger dog running. Heart rate leaped and so did the legs. I didn't look back to see what it was, but could hear it. Heavy sounding paws, and panting breathing chasing along for a while before giving up. Phew...</p>
<p>Near Tamworth there is a bike path, but don't be conned onto it.  It looks great at first, but stops and starts whenever the mood took the builders. Ramps are missing from streets. It has gaps infront of some houses: looks like they never got back to finish that bit. And then finally runs out a few km of garbage bin and parked cars later. Why are morning dog walkers dressed in black, walking black dogs? Stick to the road shoulder. The bike path has been like that for the past few years now. I don't think its going to ever be finished.</p>
<p>Found a bakery open and had hot cross buns, just out of the oven. Waited about for the shops to open. Talked with a local: Sonja for a bit. (Plan well Sonja and do what you want to.)</p>
<p>Tamworth Cycle Shop on Peel street was very helpful. They made me some spare spokes. A little tool that presses the threads into the spoke. Neat.</p>
<p>Missed buy music. The first shop in middle of Peel street  I went to had lots, but the staff were very reluctant to help. So much so that I gave up asking and left. The next shop: Music P&amp;B didn't have anything for me, but was way helpful. They sold out earlier; because the staff are so helpful!</p>
<p>Got tired of Tamworth, and headed out. Nice day, sunny and touch of coolness in the air. First day of sun in a while. Pedalled on and rolled into Barraba at 6. Just shy of 140km.  Hovered up a lot of food, had a quick hot shower, and crashed. Best nights sleep.  Will stay a few days and then continue on.</p>

                <p>Well, still resting. Spent the past couple of days sleeping. The routine has been: wake, have breakfast/lunch/dinner then sleep. Today the hacking cough has died down. Glad for that.</p>
<p>One advantage of Woolomin is the book exchange at the shop. Lots of books to read. Thinking about when to leave here. I've food for another few days yet. But need to pass through Tamworth on a week day.</p>

                <p>It wasn't great waking up. My cold is way worse than before. I really need to rest somewhere. The long day yesterday really knocked me about. Can't stop in Timor though. Asking people what was there when I was in Scone, I was told: a pub, a shop, a corner store. There are a few houses, but the pub and shop have been closed so long the buildings aren't even there. There is an old church, but its closed.</p>
<p>Nundle was 50km and a large climb away. 1.5hours walking up hill. Stopped in Nundle and ate fruit and veges. Rested and then thought I'd try Chaffy Dam. But ended up in Woolomin again. Love the hot chips here. Will rest here a few days and try and get this cold to clear up a bit. Its really knocking me about.</p>
<p>On a good note, no more broken spokes yet. And the wheels had a pounding with all the dirt roads between Scone and Nundle. I had started trying to be like on egg shells, but in the end, just went for it.</p>

                <p>Well the machines stopped about 5ish, but that was just to lul everyone into a false sense of security. I woke up about 2am - what is that noise! They had started up again. With no hope of sleep - I left. A big Hi to Phil, Frazer and Brian, who invited me to their camp. Phil is chasing fish - not any fish. Carp. These are the fish every other fisherman i've met curses and throws out. Phil is only after carp. He's looking for big ones only - up over 20kg would make him really happy.</p>
<p>The road to Musselbrook is not that wide, but has some shoulder. Same for the road to Scone. Not much traffic as you can expect at 3am. A worrying bunch walking along the streets in Mussellbrook when I stopped at the lights. Had me worried for a bit until I could read the signs on their shirts - pest control. Shooting birds as night. I didn't ask what type the rifle was.</p>
<p>Arrived in Scone at 5am. Quiet it was. Just the way I like towns. Coles opened at 6. Got some food and went to find a park.</p>
<p>As expected I broke another spoke. This time I've loosened some of the other spokes. I've tried to get them all the same tension and have the wheel true. Last time the wheel was true, but some spokes felt tighter. Feeling a bit more confident this time. Hoping this is my last one. I'm almost out of spokes.</p>
<p>Wasn't feeling the best so hung out in the park trying to nap. But more road works. When the thumpers started, I new it was time to move on.</p>
<p>Gundy was nice, but with a wedding on, it was going to be busy. Timor was only just down the road lets head there. The road got hilly. I was feeling tired. At 6 i arrived, found a spot and just about to sleep when a car stopped. I'd picked the tennis grounds. And it was tennis night. Didn't matter I fell asleep anyway.</p>
