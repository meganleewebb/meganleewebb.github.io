&lt;p&gt;So much stuff on the bike,  that first stop at Claires place we went though it all and I left another box of stuff behind - mainly clothes, and the yoga mat, thongs, etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That reduced the weight a bit.. But by the time I got to Morriset, decided to ditch some more things. I think that managed to lose 6kg of stuff here. Decided that I didn't really need to take that extra shifting spanner (on a bike with mostly allen keys), multigrips (why??), and file (what was I thinking???).. or need so much food..(months and months supply!!!)  a container of grease (on a bike with all sealed bearings!!!), half the bookcase (maps of all of Australia - what was I thinking!!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twin boys here are so cute. But so much work. Always busy.. been taking naps in the day when they sleep to recover. They just turn two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingo and Andrea have been so wonderful. Love Andreas cooking!. But after sorting out more stuff on the bike, time to hit the road again.. Leave Sunday for the nearest National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;

(I had a good time there.. no one else was at the camp sites - guess they are all working) I moved to Wolombi Pub for one night, then went to Broke. Camping in both places. Broke was a nice camp site, but got too noise - with someone wanting to keep me company so I would be lonely. They also brought their juke box along. So next day was heading to Denman very early in the morning. A rent a van stopped, and a guy lept out and said to chuck the bike in the back and he'd give me a lift. Well I said no. But we got talking, he's an artist and was heading to Tamworth to collect his paintings from the exhibition that he'd been displayed at. Obviously here I am - been helping him pack up his paintings. Ian Bettinson is his name, and the paintings were worth it. Amazing dot paintings. Glad I accepted the lift. Been here a couple of days, leaving tomorrow. Going to cycle backwards towards Sydney to see some of the national parks I skipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also add that I've been dumping stuff every stop. Getting less and less. Pushing the bike up the hills, you think carefully about what you need. Will get another shot of the bike soon. I can say that there is now space in the panniers :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Nundle</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2009/09/2009-09-28-nundle/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-09-28T12:52:00+10:00</published><updated>2009-09-28T12:52:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2009-09-28:/posts/2009/09/2009-09-28-nundle/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well packing up an exhibition was interesting.

&lt;p&gt;I cycled out of Tamworth on Tuesday morning, and got to Woolomin. The rain started there, so camped in the camp ground. Well next day was the dust storm - so wasn't going anywhere. The local shop has books that you can take and read - so spent the past week sheltering from the wind and dust, reading books. Been taking the tent down in the day - and sheltering underneath it to cut the wind down. Oh I'd like the wind to stop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was 1 Degree. With the wind, its cold. I'm going to wait about for another couple of days for this cold front to pass, and the weather to warm up. There is a forecast for 30C on Wednesday or Thursday. Just heard that its 8C now, and that doesn't count the wind!!! Not sure about Barrington Tops either at the moment. Everyone is saying its always cold there. I don't think my clothes are up for the cold. The question I'm still thinking is wether to sit here in Nundle, or go back down to Woolomin where its a bit warmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still not so good with taking pictures. So no pictures yet. Still getting rid of stuff on the bike, though, the items are small now -&amp;gt; do I need this cloth? Still would like it to be lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been talking to lots of locals and tourists (as you do shivering in a campsite). By far the most common exclaimation is 'your mad' followed by 'get more gears'. But some people think its a good idea (even if they wouldn't do it themself)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meals have settled down to once a day - doing a large rice/pasta/vege dish about lunch time, with any desserts if there are any. Eat any fruit when I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What ever I do, I'll be heading in Walcha eventually and will get another update up then.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Nundle, Woolomin, Tamworth, Manila</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2009/10/2009-10-13-nundle-woolomin-tamw/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-13T09:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2009-10-13T09:00:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2009-10-13:/posts/2009/10/2009-10-13-nundle-woolomin-tamw/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the quick update at Nundle, I headed up to Hanging Rock.

The plan was to head to Barrington Tops. However, it was cold!! It was midday when I got up there, had lunch at a place called Shiba Dam (Had a picnic at Hanging Rock), and I was shivering. If it was that cold at midday, I thought the nights might be too cold for me, so I headed back to Woolomin. Took me 1.5 hours to walk up to Hanging Rock, and 5 minutes to coast down. I did camp one night at Nundle, and found ice on the tent in the morning when I woke. Woolomin was cold, but not as cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for the last three weeks, there has been lots of shivering! Still getting rid of stuff - down to just a pair of sandals now - got rid of the shoes I had. I've never liked shoes that much, so not sure why I thought I would suddenly start wearing them now. Gone. 1.5kg lighter (they were heavy shoes!!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing about Woolomin was that Merv and George had all these books. The General Store had books also, so I did a lot of reading while I was there. George went ferreting on the last weekend, and brought me a rabbit skin. I wanted to try brain tanning it. Well, I learnt alot about hides - fleshing the hide wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. After several hours, cramps in my hands, holes in the pelt, I admitted defeat. I know for next time - start with a more comfortable handled knife, a hard surface to work on, have water handy, and probably start on not such an old rabbit. The pelt was from and old female and was very mangy. But still for a first try, I was happy. No I didn't get to the tanning stage. Next time. Though then I'll have to catch the rabbit myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For interested people, here is the link on how I was going to do the tanning: http://www.braintan.com/articles/furs/miller1.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in Tamworth yesterday, but had internet problems so didn't get an update.  I'm now at the Manila caravan park. And it is a nice park. My lesson from yesterday is 'drink water'. I set out from Woolomin about 8, got to Tamwoth at 9:30, did postal stuff, internet, some shopping, and then set out. About lunch time cramps started, and I struggled on to Manilia before thinking about why. Realised that I'd only drunk about a liter all day, and the day was very dry. Also had a head wind the whole way. (Why is it that when I stop the wind goes the way I want to head, but the moment I start riding I get a head wind?) Decided that I'll rest up here for a couple of days to recover before moving on.  There are also more books here to read :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry to all the people that I've got email addresses for that I've not emailed yet. I keep forgetting and packing the address book at the bottom of the bags. Sooner or later I'll rememeber and keep it on top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the first day not shivering, and now the weather here has gone cold :( Hope the washing dries - my jumper is in it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Manilla, Barraba</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2009/10/2009-10-23-manilla-barraba/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-10-23T10:56:00+11:00</published><updated>2009-10-23T10:56:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2009-10-23:/posts/2009/10/2009-10-23-manilla-barraba/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Decided that needed to move on from Manilla.

The day was windy and dusty, so thought I might as well be walking northwards. It was very windy and dusty on the road. Almost headed back to Manilla. Had decided that I'd only stop in Barraba for water, but when I got here, thought I'd stay the night. One night led to two, to three... Been here more than a week so far.. Going to stay a few more too. There is the Barraba Festival on in the first weekend in November - so will probably stay for that. I'm staying at the Barraba Caravan Park. (Hi Bob.) Its quiet and peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting things that have happened - I cut my hair! This is the first time in I don't remember how many years. So it was a good cut. I used scissors first - but the cut was uneven. Then in a second had shop I found some hand clippers for only $10. Bargin. I was so excited. Today, for the first time all week, my hair is even. Number 000 clippers - pretty close to a shave without using a razor. Not sure yet if I'll just stick to the clippers, or actually do the shaving. Time will tell. It certainly is a change from my long hair. Dries quick though, and is easier to wash. Also saves on shampoo and conditioner :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days are passing watching the insect life (there are lots of ants about here - all different sizes, shapes), playing with the Roly Poly's (
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillidiidae&lt;/a&gt;

The drips were from the seems over the top of the tent. I thought it was leaking when I was in Woolomin, but as I had the vents open, wasn't certain if the water was from that or not. Another possibility at the time was from my raincoat - I had been in and out a few times. Decided not to worry about it then, and wait until we had more rain to check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the weekends rain made it clear that it was leaking.  I have an Exped, 2 person,  Auriga Mesh tent. Well had. Called Mountain Equipment in Sydney, and talked with Heather. the tent is 6 months old. Considering that I've only been using it the last 6 weeks - that's not much use yet. Heather said they have never had problems with these tents, so she thinks this may be faulty. I posted the rain fly back to Sydney yesterday.  Exped has a 5 year warrenty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the mean time, I have a 3 person tent from Barbeques Galore. It cost me the pricely sum of $49. I also bought a green poly tarp from Bunnings just in case. The 3 person is more roomy, not as ventilated, but so far, has kept the rain off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tarp is also for covering the tent when the sun is out - if I'm not moving. Tents don't like the sun - and all of them have warnings about prolonged UV exposure. So if I'm in a spot that is very sunny and am not moving for a while, then I'll cover the tent with the tarp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the moment I'll stay in Barraba a bit longer, but thinking its getting time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Return to Sydney</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2009/11/2009-11-10-return-to-sydney/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2009-11-10T08:02:00+11:00</published><updated>2009-11-10T08:02:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2009-11-10:/posts/2009/11/2009-11-10-return-to-sydney/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yep, you read that right.

The short story is that I've cannot carry enough water by bicycle to do the things I want - travel to remote places. The places I've been are dry. The more water I carry, the heavier it is, and the more I drink pushing it up hills. End result, I cannot get to places I want. My knee has also been a bit sore, my tent is in Sydney getting repaired.  When I bought a motorcycle, the bicycle would return to Sydney anyway... And so, seemed the time to return to look about Sydney shops, see a doc, recover tent, etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Sunday I left Barraba and travelled to Manilla. Monday morning I left Manilla at 6am to get to Tamworth in time for the CountryLink train to Sydney.&lt;/p&gt;

Had a test ride on the Yamaha TTR-250 - but I've a shortage of height... Found stopping scary - not being able to touch the ground except on tippy toes. The Yamaha XT250 looked nice... but no kick start.. I decided that I didn't want to have to push start my bike if the battery was feeling slack. Used to do that in the past. It was hard work on bitumen, I reckon it would be a lot harder on dirt or sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Scorpio was it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have build a rack to go on it - version 2 is much nicer than version 1. Version 1 weighed 10kg  and wasn't finished - that is when I thought it was way way over engineered, and scrapped it..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to head out of Sydney for a week to test how it all goes. Will have photos up from that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Megan,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lana and I are following your adventurous journey. It seems scary sometimes, but glad to hear that you are safe. I think getting a motorcycle is a great idea. You'll have a lot more freedom to actually get to places and do things you want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have moved into our new house and have plenty of room for you to come visit when you're done travelling in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nash&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The week trip went well enough. The ride went from Sydney north. Stayed with friends in Morriset for a few days. Then camped in the Watagans back to the first camp site. I made the mistake of riding in in the rain. When the guide says 'slippery when wet' they really mean it. The road that was hard dirt when I bicycled, turned to slippery clay in the rain. It was a dreadful time riding the motorcycle in. If the first bit hadn't been uphill, and I hadn't been worried about dropping the bike, I'd had turned around half way up the hill and left. By the top of the hill, the prospect of trying to ride down it was also scary enough that I pushed on. I was sorry with that decision more than once before hitting the campground. Luckily by the time I left two days later, it had stopped raining and the road was hard again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Watagans, I went to Barrington Tops and camped near the river. Great swimming spot if you were inclined. Unfortunately the stay was spoilt  by the amount of rubbish and crap about. The toilets near by had been demolished to build a new block, but there where other toilets further away. A lot of people hadn't used these. The bush between the campsite and the river was disgusting. Burying waste doesn't seem to happen. Walking past turds to get to the water, spoilt the idea of swimming for me. Talking to some other campers nearby, they didn't have a problem with swimming or drinking the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrington Tops to Broke. But didn't like the feel of Broke this time, so moved on and camped elsewhere. An advantage of the motorcycle - can easily move no matter how late in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the riding was okay, if I stayed going slow. Riding on the freeway was boring as.  So monotonous. Everyone goes fast there. I thought trucks were speed limited to 100km/hr? These seems to not be the case. Learners limited to 80km/hr - doesn't seem the case either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stayed in Sydney for the Xmass/New Year period. After this I set off to Canberra. My planned leisurely trip was cut short by the realisation that unless I hit the freeway, I wouldn't get there until late at night. Since my uncle and aunty were expecting me for tea, I took the freeway.  With rest stops and hills, I got to Canberra in time for tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After catching up with family for a couple of days I set off North. I camped places I new - so end up staying in Barraba again. Went to see some of the sites that I hadn't seen when I was there previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Barraba to the Gold Coast was a 9.5 hour ride. I did stop over in Texas!!  Let me say that soon as I crossed the border into Queensland, it day seemed brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last bit of road close to the Gold Coast was uneasy. The traffic had picked up. The roads where single lane, and no one drives to the speed limit. It didn't matter if the zone was a 40, 60, 80 or 100 km/hr.  I had thought my speedo was inaccurate - but no. People speed. Worse than speeding for me was the unsafe overtaking that occurred. Drivers have been watching too many tv commercials and believe that their car/truck can overtake anything instantly. It didn't matter blind curves, oncoming traffic - drivers would overtake. There were several times when I had to slow down to let the over taking complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After staying with friends on the Gold Coast, I set the GPS for Cairns and set off. I'm so glad for the GPS. I'm not sure where I went, I just followed the roads - well as near as was practicable. I haven't updated the maps, so some streets had changed, but drive on and  "recalculating"  soon sorted it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a long day I stopped outside Rockhampton. I sign that I wasn't thinking well - I booked into a van park near the road. Not only near the road, but near a train line also. Both kept up throughout the night. Even with ear plugs in, you could still hear them. The vibrations did provide a sort of massage through the ground. And the mossies!!! I don't think I'd set the tent up so fast and jumped in. Hordes of mossies. I've never seen so many mossies. They where like fur on the outside of the tent wanting to get in. I didn't leave the tent all night. Next morning I fully dressed in motorcycle gear - including helmet and gloves before exiting and packing up. A fast packup even with all that. I was glad to be moving again and be out of the mossies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was another long day - and I reached my grandmothers house about 7:30pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doors where already closed, and after knocking and banging. I called her on the phone. We then had 10 minutes of comedy before I convinced her that I really was outside. I was looking forward to a shower. Unfortunately grandma closed the door again from habit. This time the phone was inside. I did eventually get inside - it just took a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm about 120km south of Cairns. Visiting my folks.  The nearest town is Moresby, the nearest major town is Innisfail. Check them out in Google. Its been raining since I got here, but today the sun is out and the humidity is back. I sweat sitting still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride from the Gold Coast to here, was a nightmare. I never want to to that again. Ever. When I was younger I had motorcycles, and did long rides. I remember the hard part was the sitting - cramped muscles, insect stings - I rode without gloves, and with an open face helmet. This trip the other motorist where the worry. Traffic has grown more heavy since I last rode a motorcycle. Trucks have gotten bigger. Super sized!  Even on the motorcycle, these things whip up the wind when they pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While on dual lane roads, it was okay. Everyone overtook in the other lane. On single lane roads -&amp;gt; I lost track of the number of times slowing down to let drivers finish overtaking. Drivers over took on double lines, corners, turn lanes, on the left on a single lane road!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone speeds. The only vehicle I overtook on the way up was a tractor - doing 30 in a 60 zone. Everyone else overtook me. Didn't matter if I was sitting on the speed limit in the zone - I was overtaken. And the car/truck then vanished into the distance.  If I moved a bit too left to avoid a patch on the road - someone would try to overtake. I ended up on the road shoulder several times - forced there by people overtaking.  Once I ended up on the shoulder when a truck overtook, and as it passed, I saw that a car was overtaking it at the same time! Following too closely - trucks, cars or buses - it didn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I miss a rule that says that the speed limit is the minimum and there is some speed over that that you must do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police? Yeah, getting a speeding ticket is "Bad Luck". There are so few police on the roads, that it really is a case of bad luck if your busted for speeding, following too closely, or any other traffic offense. I saw two cop cars/speed checks the whole way up. They were evident by the flashing lights of people coming towards me and the general slow down of speeds until they'd been passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to get to the end of the trip up here. If people were overtaking me like that, then what is coming around the next corner? "Accidents" shouldn't be called accidents. They are crashes, and the surprising thing is that there are so few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been here for two weeks now, and the dodge'em car road driving conditions continues. If you've ever had a car sitting on your tail light and your doing 100km/hr in a 100km/hr zone, you might know the worry of it. The only advantage to being in an 80km/hr or 60km/hr  zone is that the speed is slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be honest to say I'm not enjoying riding the motorcycle on the roads with other traffic. I'm also suffering from a bad case of  bicycle withdrawals. Going to have to do something about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Bicycle, Bicycle, I want to ride my Bicycle!!!!</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/02/2010-02-14-bicycle-bicycle-i-wa/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-02-14T12:48:00+11:00</published><updated>2010-02-14T12:48:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-02-14:/posts/2010/02/2010-02-14-bicycle-bicycle-i-wa/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bicycle absence symptoms became too much.

After brooding about it for a few weeks, and riding the motorcycle about - I'm getting my bicycle back.  Well, soonish.  I now rate the motorcycle as one of the silliest decisions I've made. Missing bicycling too much. So, if I'm not able to get to every part of Australia that I'd like to because of riding a bicycle, then so be it. That still leaves a heck of a lot of country to see. And in the end, I'd rather be bicycling and miss seeing things, than not cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've very very lucky that my friend Claire convinced me to leave my bicycle at her place, rather than sell it. So lucky!  Before my bicycle comes back, it is going to get an small upgrade. Yeah, going for some gears this time around. The guys at
Cheeky Transport &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt; for http://www.cheekytransport.com.au&lt;/sup&gt;
(Adam,Dave,Nic,Lee) are going to sort that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I miss about the bicycle? Heres a list in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedaling, the sense of achievement when you arrive at your destination, the slower speed, being involved with your surroundings,  picking up useful things (some people call this junk!!!) from the side of the road, spotting the things on the side of the road, seeing everything, the sounds of the countryside, feeling the cool air in the hollows, the gentle breezes, feel of rain falling, being warm when its wet, exercise, being able to eat all you want, not having to stop at service stations (once upon a time, you might have gotten service, now all you do is pay for the lack of service, and the petrol), not using petrol (I don' t know about you, but the smell of petrol isn't on my "nice" smells list), doing the best with where you are, the sound of your cleats clicking in, wind on your face, ease of jump on and off, being able to lift it over a fence,  the silence, not having to wear earplugs, being able to eat all you want, whirring of the free wheel, remembering the journey (you remember the hills that you struggle up, the corner when you were tired,  the view when you top a hill), downhill thrills, the tired feeling after a days cycling, hearing the birds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well you get the idea.. Lots of good things..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss my bike.

&lt;p&gt;I'm so lucky that Claire kept my bike for me. Thanks also to Claire for giving me back a rack to be able to leave Sydney now. I ordered another Tubus Cosmo, but it has not arrived yet. So I've the old one off Claire, and she will get the new one when it arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trip to Sydney was a rush decision. Needed a break from my family, and wanted to get my bicycle. Had some other stuff to sort out, that I could have in a pinch have sorted without being in Sydney, but that just gave me an excuse to come down and get my bicycle, rather than wait for it to post up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not been able to catch up with all the people I wanted to. Kind of hard to fit it in with friends working. So, sorry to everyone I didn't get to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can give a better summay of what has been happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride from Morriset to Wollombi was hard. It was hot, and the ride seemed to be always uphill. I did a detour in the Watagans to visit my old camp site. Yep it was still there.. This 20km detour I was to regret as the day went on.  My days of sitting about had reduced my fitness and expanded my waitline. I wheezed and huffed and puffed along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was good to be back on the bike. Only saw a couple of cars all day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wollombi to Broke.  Was feeling so tired this day. Riding slow. Sore legs. By the time I got to Broke I just wanted to rest. So I did. Met up with Dennis again. Lucky this time he was not all doom and gloom about my travels. I had a bit of the flu - nose runnign, sore throat. So ate oranges and rested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broke to Denman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Felt stronger and got to Jerry Plains just on 12. But then it started getting really hot. In the next three hours, only went 2km. Lots of resting in the shade of trees. Even at 4pm the sun was still burning. I was a bit worried about being lost - as I'd taken a side ride. And well, a very rough map, and my sense of direction, I was hoping that it would go to Denman in the end.. It did.  Hung out in the park and drank lots of water. Road out of town as the sun set and camped by the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denman, Musselbrook, Scone. Hung out in the park for a while then rode out to the Washingpools Camp area. This is in a National Park - so you have to pay to camp there. I'd been told it was free. Had a good swim, and a wash, set up camp, and started to sleep. But then all these cars started to arrive, kids with alcohol, loud voices, and a duf duf box. I packed up about 9pm and left. Cars where still arriving. Music thumping. I pity the poor people I left behind that where hoping for a quiet night. Riding in the dark by moon light (and my lights) was good.. It was quiet, cool, peaceful. Even on the highway, you got lots of warning of cars/trucks comming. Ended up stopping Widgen. There was a horse event the Saturday/Sunday - so lots of people (and horses).  Could have had a hot shower here also if I'd waited long enough.. But I didn't - figured that I'd be hot and sweaty before to long so why bother...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widgen to Wallabadah&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car drivers know nothing about hills. Been hearing about the Murrurundi Hills. But it turned out that it was easy as. 30 minutes climb and then a long downhill. Easy...  See the last post of "A big Hill'.. The harder part was the long climb out of Willow Tree to Wallabadah. The climb seems to go on and on... It was also very hot that day, so that didn't help.  But like all things - it passes and Wallabadah was a great spot to stay the night. I had planned on being in Woolomin, but was too tired to go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the first puncture today in Murrurundi. Wasn't watching and rode over a tent peg on the road. Clang, crash, clang, it rattled about with the wheel until pissssss.. Then it fell off. This was right outside a servo, with a broken air pump.. Least it was shady patching it..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got the great comment then from on the the drivers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Gee you got a lot of stuff"   What could I do but laugh.. He was walking to his 4x4 packed to the roof with stuff,  the roof rack heaped, and towing a caravan..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallabadah to Woolomin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another not so flat rode. Went over some "Gap" Was moving too fast to read the name.. But it was a lot of uphill then a long downhill. Got 68Km/hr on the downhill - a new speed record for this trip. Serious downhill. Woolomin was nice - stocked up with heaps of books from the General Store, and ate lots of their hot chips - had a real craving for them, so had three lots. Best chips I've tasted. Talked with a few of the people from the last trip there..Rested, slept...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 7&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolomin to Attunga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nice ride. Stopped and talked to Terry on the side of the road. He has a drinking water business. Rode into Tamworth and meet up with Claire and Wayne
&lt;a href="http://www.cwbikingoz.com/"&gt;http://www.cwbikingoz.com/&lt;/a&gt;
as soon as I stopped. Found Tamworth too busy feeling, so after a quick stop for a screw for my sandals, some food, I kept cycling to Attunga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Barry and Margaret of Attunga who let me stay in their back yard, feed me, and gave me a hot shower. My first since leaving Morriset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 8 Attunga to Barraba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A slow day, seemed be a lot of gentle uphills. Apart from a stop at the Manilla cake shop (yum!!!) nothing much to say. Arrived in Barraba and met up with people I knew. Lots were surprised to see me back so soon. A nice place to hang out for easter when all the busy people are on the roads..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing day!!! Had been washing my clothes when I could. I didn't think they smelled, but had a lot of salt in them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>My tent</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/04/2010-04-01-my-tent/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-04-01T18:47:00+11:00</published><updated>2010-04-01T18:47:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-04-01:/posts/2010/04/2010-04-01-my-tent/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/01042010-754256.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yaamba to St Lawrence;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marlborough. I meet another cyclist outside of Bowen -&amp;gt; Colin. Talking with him about camping at Marlborough Hotel - he had a much better experience than me.  He also got water off them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Lawrence - Thanks to the couple that gave me the tin of baked beans and some bread. That was dinner when I arrived.  Another couple gave me some fruit and veges from a food hamper that they had won earlier up the coast. They didn't have a fridge and couldn't eat all the food. It was much appreciated. Food prices at St Lawrence shops where much more reasonable - so I bought other food there. Actually, when I left the I had much too much food in my pannier. But this was soon fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Lawrence to Sarina; Well the day was to have stopped at Ilbilbi.  But when I arrived it was blowing a wind - a  wonderful tailwind.. What can you do - you keep going.  It was showering by this time also, with heavy rain just outside of Sarina.  The ladies at the Sarina Information Center were very helpful - and found a caravan park 10km further North that only wanted $10 for an unpowered site.  It also had the advantage of being opposite a fruit and vege shop and was out of town.  It was a good spot. I ate  a bag of mandarins and bananas for dinner :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarina to Proserpine:  Well actually I camped about 30km from Proserpine. More tail winds and showers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proserpine to Guthalungra: More tail winds. This was when I caught up with Colin. We rode from Bowen to Guthalungra.  Colin had started in Melbourne and was doing the round Australia trip. But was travelling to fast for his plan. So we parted company the next morning.  I got to check out his tent and gear.  His tent was only 1.5Kg - was so envious!!  Mine weighed in at just over 3kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the day that one set of clothes died. The shirt and shorts had rotted too much, and had too many holes in them by this time. With it damp, and no chance to dry them it wasn't going to be safe to wear them another day.  Now they were both worn when I started, so it was to be expected. Still it was a bit sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guthalungra to Alligator Creek:  Stopped in Home Hill for a bit, but had the "want to keep pedaling" urge. So kept going. It was still showering on and off.  I was in a mood that I just wanted to get North.  Was wondering about this cycle touring business. And probably more importantly was tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alligator Creek to Kennedy. This was my biggest day. 197km. A definite "keep pedaling". Though the travelling after Ingham was not energetic. I had planned to wild camp outside of Cardwell - but it was low lying land and very very wet. Yes it was still showering, but there had been recent heavy rains I was told, and all the water was still lying about the land.  I thought about cycling up and down the road to get 200km for the day - but was too tired to be bothered to do this. I also thought that I could have finished the trip to my parents that day by continuing to cycle as it was only 70km to go - but arriving after 9pm would have been a problem for my folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained during the night and I was clear that my tent was leaking again!!! Hard to miss the large drops hitting you in the head. Doh!!! Moved over and then put a container for the drops to splat in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy to Parents Place :)  Managed to get a leech on me riding along the road. How was that possible - did it drop from the sky - or is it a gliding variety?  Met a Scottish couple just outside of Silkwood. The first that I've meet travelling south.  They had wet gear on. I didn't. It was cooler riding in the rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so now that I'm here, now what?  Title of this post says it all. Just stopping pedaling for a couple of days now has improved my thinking. I was travelling fast. Too fast in hindsight.  A bit obsessive compulsive of me. In future need to have more rest stops and not go so far each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of me a sore and hurt. Legs felt a bit tired. But with the 197km day that was to be expected. Bum wasn't as  bad as you might think  - I was used to the saddle. Been on that one for years now. Bit tender, but nothing that painful.  My left shoulder hurts. Pinched or twisted something and it hurt for most of the ride. Colin when trying my bike commented that the position was a lot of weight on the arms. This might be right - will have to look at this and change the riding position. I notice that my new grips - the right hand one has a worn spot, the left one not-&amp;gt; me leaning more on my right side to take the weight of the left arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to send my tent back for another warranty claim. My Thermarest is also in problems - so it goes also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about vans and travelling with petrol/diesel for stretches of the ride. But now that I'm rested, sanity has returned. I'm looking at how to lower the weight of the gear I have, and perhaps increase the luggage carrying to have more luxuries with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that I found important on the ride - being able to dry my clothes. This would have been helped if I'd stopped and rested more days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to sit out of the rain and away from all the ants. Some places lying on the ground out of the tent wasn't comfortable for all the ants that wanted to check me out for food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books - I missed reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charging the mobile - I had ebooks, but the phone needed charging at times. This is part of the reason for the missed posts. Stopping and resting would have helped this also. But will sort out some charging off the dynamo for next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to chuck out the stuff that sat in the bottom of my panniers - or at least examine it closely. If it didn't see use in a month of the east coast - what was I carrying it for still!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water purification - will look at some filters to see how to get water from all the ground sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, at the moment sitting about, eating, looking at new bike frames like Surly Big Dummy and Xtracycles. Looking at two wheeled trailers. There are bicycle mobile homes. Thinking of options.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Yuba Mundo Arrives</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/05/2010-05-25-yuba-mundo-arrives/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-05-25T19:56:00+10:00</published><updated>2010-05-25T19:56:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-05-25:/posts/2010/05/2010-05-25-yuba-mundo-arrives/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Due to a one thing and another, and Ben and I exchanging emails all of last week, and my frame didn't leave the shop until Friday 21st May.

Fedex estimated a delivery date of 31st. I was hopeful, but thought it might take longer, but checked their tracking site almost hourly :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning it surprised me. While I was thinking it was just leaving Sydney, it arrived. How is that possible - from USA to the middle of no where so quick. Four days!!! I order stuff in Australia, and it takes longer than that. Needless to say, I'm very happy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasted no time unpacking and starting assembly. Thanks heaps Ben. It was well wrapped and padded in the box. It was so exciting unwrapping each item and finding what was there. I can't say enough good things about Ben at Yuba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See below for all unpacking images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally it was unwrapped and on the floor. Initial impression - its solid. Just what I ordered. I'm happy with the  finish - it is what it is. A good value, cargo bike frame. For the record, there were no scratches on the paint before I started. But as this is going to get a work out touring, I'll be buying some touch up paint at some point. I also assembled with the help of grease. My reasoning is this is a metal frame, its going to spend pretty much all its life outside, a bit of grease on parts will help slow any rust down. The insides of the frame will also get a squirt of something oily also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First order was getting wide loaders on. Then start to transfer other components from my MTB to it. Wide loaders just went on without any problems. Just slide on and tighten up the bolts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then things got interesting. Some things I thought would be a problem, weren't. Others that I thought would be no problem at all - are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the problems - at the moment two standing out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had planned on using my existing front hydraulic brake, and was leaning towards just using v-brakes on the back to get rolling. But the front hose hose is too short, and its going to need a ton of spacers and longer bolts to fit the caliper. That blew the option of getting it ridable. Time to either get a new front brake, or find spacers and a longer hose. Thinking about it now, I was probably overly optimistic thinking I could use my existing front brake - it was for a very special fork setup, and I did want to raise the handle bars on that bike anyway - so of course the brake hose would be too short!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next was the Rohloff.  I ordered the axle adapters as the Mundo dropouts are 14mm and the Rohloff axles are 10mm. After taking a drill to the adapters, they fit the axle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to drop the wheel in. I had thought that I'd just drop the wheel in, make an clamp to hold the torsion arm, and be done. This isn't to be. Using the torsion arm and external gear mech on this frame, it is not going to work. Both parts need to be below the frame and so don't fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dropouts are 7mm steel plate. Looking from the rear with the wheel out, the left hand dropout is flush with the tubing the forms the frame. The right hand side is mounted about the middle of the tubing. This means that there is only the width of the dropout, before the tube bulges out. On the other side of the tube is the disk mount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a lot playing with different angles on the axle plate I have, I think that either the OEM axle plate will just work, or the OEM2 axle plate will work with some help. Not 100% certain just yet. I need to find dimensions for the Rohloff drop outs to see how they compare to what metal is available on the Mundo. The Mundo dropouts are long with lots of thick steel - so the OEM is probably going to be the best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be taking a welder to the frame though what ever happens. With lots of putting the back wheel in, and taking it back out again, the axle adapters got annoying real fast. They are small, round, and both want to drop off when your not expecting it, and roll away. The other thing that bugged me about them is that the drop out is 7mm thick, but the axle adapters are 4mm wide. I'd like to get a bit more axle in the dropout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More installing tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd love to have an internal gear hub on my Mundo, but the ones in my price range aren't rated for any serious loads.  its a shame because I love the gear hubs on my other bikes, even if they are just 3 speeds.  Did you consider the Nuvinci CVP hub before deciding on the Rohloff?  I think I may one day put one of those on mine, partly because they are cheaper and partly because the idea of continuously variable transmission intrigues me (plus it has been done before on the Long Walk To Green blog and held up to heavy loads well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wish you the best of luck with your build, and once you take it out for a spin I think you will enjoy the ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn't think about any other hub. I had the Rohloff already. I've used Rohloff hubs in load bikes before. Friends have also. Never had a problem. Some of the bikes had way more load, and way stronger riders powering them, than I am. So the hub is built to last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Megan.  Good blog.  Makes me want to ride more......&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I too have a V3- its awesome- Likely a good choice for being tough when you aren't consumed with weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine is pretty bare bones, however, external gears and vee brakes.  I have custom fitted aluminium checkplate to the rear rack and sideloaders, added Sweetskinz tires, Electra chrome plated fenders, and a Rolling  Jackass centrestand.  Maybe discs later this year.....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I get a front rack on my V3 I will post some pics somewhere. Will be following your Rohloff build. Cheers from Canada's west coast. John&lt;/p&gt;

Arrrg...It still is a problem :( The 160mm Rohloff rotor is too small (Well that or the disk mount is too high.) I had suspected that before, but was assured that it would all be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the adapter when I realised that I had two different sized ones, helped slightly, but not enough. Still too little disk rotor is under the pads. And still too much for me to "fix" by changes to the dropouts. Not happy. I could have ordered a larger rotor earlier, and not be sitting now waiting again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sighs&lt;/em&gt; more waiting time. Need to order a larger rotor. Rohloff don't do a 180mm or 185mm any more, so its either 190mm or 203mm. Yuba recommended a 180mm Rotor, so I'm going to go with the 190mm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, more daily trips to the post office waiting for a larger rotor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front fits without any dramas. So I've one brake. Might fit up the chain and have bit of a ride about on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>New Rotor arrives</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/06/2010-06-15-new-rotor-arrives/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-15T17:09:00+10:00</published><updated>2010-06-15T17:09:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-06-15:/posts/2010/06/2010-06-15-new-rotor-arrives/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/20100615.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new rotor arrived today. Its actually the 190mm Magura option from Rohloff. As I guessed, it is a bit big for the caliper to bolt onto. Yuba recommending a 180mm for the rear. I think a 185 would be just spot on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I ordered the frame, I also I ordered the adapter from Yuba for the rear 180mm disk. Looking at it now, its way too small. The brakes arrived with two different size adapters - 1 small  (that almost matches the Yuba one),  and one larger - that works better on the rear. Better, but not perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image above has the caliper resting down onto the top of the rotor. This is with the axle adapters on the Rohloff hub, in the 14mm dropouts. At both ends its about 5mm to bolt flat to the adapter. (Its easier to see the gap on the front bolt.) This will sort its self out tomorrow when the dropouts get narrowed. I'll get some more metal at the bottom of each dropout - and the rotor will drop downward. I might also put some spacers between the adapter, and the caliper to fine tune the height - to get it just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm excited now - this is all stuff that can be done by me - so there is not more waiting for parts to arrive. Baring any unexpected developments, I should be able to have a ride tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are close!  I had a similar experience with Hayes hydraulics on a Kona Mtb- acutally found some thick aluminum washers to shim the calipers up so my pads were contacting the disc perfectly.  As you say, your dropouts rework gives you latitude to adjust this.  J.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes it looks like your close to getting rear disc brakes on a Yuba (one of a very small elite group in the world I think!). Loving the blog (more pics please!) and great to see another Mundo builder in Australia. You seem to have the new style of rear disc mount (on my V3 the 2 holes are parallel to the frame) which is no doubt making the process easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a lot longer than I thought, but then I got the wheel back in and the disks are on. 160mm front, 190mm rear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was lots of assembling  and disassembling it all, checking with small spacers the amount of metal to add in. I had forgotten about …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-06-16-image0.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a lot longer than I thought, but then I got the wheel back in and the disks are on. 160mm front, 190mm rear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning was lots of assembling  and disassembling it all, checking with small spacers the amount of metal to add in. I had forgotten about the axle adapter I had on yesterday  - that was an extra 2mm. All up the wheel dropped down 7mm from the original dropout spot. I ended up getting a 14mm bolt, filing the grove for the 10mm axle, and brazing that in the dropout. Then a 4mm plate on the long part of the dropout slot at the rear to get the whole thing to 10mm.  Lots of filing today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works, but its still going to be a bit fiddly to change the wheel. The wheel will not just drop in or out. The axle plate on the Rohloff hits the chain stay tube when at the front of the dropout. With the 14mm dropouts, I didn't notice this as there is more room on both sides for it to all move about. With the dropouts being 10mm, its noticeable. If I put the 4mm on the opposite side (the front of the dropout slot) it would have been better. Putting the wheel in or out, there is some jiggling, and rotating the external gear mech and the OEM axle adaptor, before it all drops in (or out). I'm not about to change it now. I don't need to get the wheel on/off that often, and its not that hard to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have a moment of wondering if the 203mm disk would be a just bolt on. There is enough room for it. Decided not to try it - as I didn't want to wait more days for a rotor and adapter.  Also had a wonder if there was another size caliper adapter that I could have used instead. Anyway if at some time in the future I want to change it, the bits added in can all be ground out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chain - I wanted to have the chain tensioner pushing up, but it didn't work out. The chain hits on the wide loader. Down still works. Don't know how many links on the chain, and I'm not counting them. I'm running 39/16 cogs, with 165mm cranks. Ended up using a half link to get the length just right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as I finished, it started raining - and hasn't stopped. So there was a very short ride in the liquid sunshine.. The brakes feel a bit spongy. Need to ride a bit more to see if that is a real problem, or just my perception of them. Both hoses are too long. The front has way too much hose. Not sure if this affects the brake feeling. Will check this out more when its not raining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The weather encourages getting mudguards on next. They will not go on easily. Brake calipers are in the way. Can make up short adapters to fix this, but am also thinking about making up some wider guards. I running 1.35 tires on at the moment, at some point I might want to got bigger. I'd like to not have hassles with mud guards then. Going to go hunt about tomorrow and see whats available. Corflute would be handy right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also will put a piece of tube over the chain runs - as I want to try and keep muck off the chain as much as possible. It will also help keep the  bottom run from slapping against the frame. Ideal would be fully enclosed chain running in oil, but that's to hard to do. But any covering has to help with keeping the chain clean. Certainly will help with keeping me clean. I have a piece of 13mm poly tube, but want to try with a larger size. Another thing for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of interest, I wondered what the load limit on the Rohloff is. Ended up sending Rohloff an email last night asking. The answer is; there isn't any - but you do have to honor the gearing limits they set. So I can pick up as much stuff as I want - long as I can pedal it. That works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience with brand new disc brakes is that it takes time for all of the little imperfections on the pads to wear off, and all the little imperfections in the rotor to be impressed upon the pads. Once this has happened the effective surface area of the rotor is increased and the braking power improves a lot.  The same is true for drum brakes (although the break-in is shorter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good stuff.  Keep us posted.  I echo keller74's comments that your disc tab is different than my V3- with my holes essentially parallel to the chainstay.  Also I noticed threaded bosses on the downtube near the head on Jim's orange V3 that are not my V3.  For the bread rack I guess?  John&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chain guard - ended up trying electrical conduit. I wanted a tube over the top chain run, and the bottom.  Spent most of the day heating, bending, filing, assembling and disassembling the chain. I don't want the chain guard rubbing on the hub. With careful bending and filing - I did acheive that, and still had the tube bending in to enclose the chain. I think this was a waste of effort now. It took a long time, and really doesn't do that much for the guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial try had a bend on both ends. The conduit has some flex - but the problem was getting the chain linked up. I find it easier to link the chain on the chain ring. This didn't allow that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chopped the front off - and shortened the back. But not sure if I'm happy with it at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented with using just floating pipes over the two chain runs. Thinking about doing that, and leaving the chain ring free. Also thinking of other ways to cover the chain ring up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have access to brazing gear and was going to add tabs on for the guard. But now, thinking to cable tied it on only until I'm sure. I'll sleep on it tonight and have another look tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Woo Hoo - riding</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/06/2010-06-18-woo-hoo-riding/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-18T19:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2010-06-18T19:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-06-18:/posts/2010/06/2010-06-18-woo-hoo-riding/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/20100618.jpg" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My quick ride the other day was as a single speed. Decided today to quickly fix the gear changer and work that Rohloff. In a common story, it took way longer than I thought it would. The cable outers for the gear changer ended up being 1870mm long. Easy to cut them - used side cutters and then filed them flat. The liners - scissors. Cutting the inners was hard. The two pairs of side cutters in the shed both didn't want to cut. They mushed and chewed. I thought about using a pair of scissors, but ended up using the grinder. It wasn't the best and I wished for proper cutters. I'm thinking to either buy a pair and carry them with me, or better yet, find a bike shop to precut some inners to the length I need. Arrggh - to do that I'd need to take the cables out and measure them. I don't know how much is inside the twist shifter. So, next time I have to change a cable - I'll try and remember to measure then, and then get them cut to length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly I had to put a side the nice thick tubed handle bar from Yuba. By the time the brake lever, shifter, and a small bit of grip went on, there was no space left for the bar ends. I did like the extra rise it gave. Used the old bar I had, but will look to replace it with a steel tube sometime. I through on the lights, and old mud guards, adjusted the seat height, and headed out for a longer ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brakes are starting to feel better. The front ended up getting some washers between the fork and the caliper to space it out far enough to adjust correctly.  The rear by careful design by me (yeah right! - pull the other one.) was spot on - no spacers needed.  By the time the rear hose was routed, it was okay for length. The front hose is really too long. I'll wait until I'm at a shop to shorten it. I don't want to risk not having a brake here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yuba cargo bag goes on well. I was going to keep the space look to the frame, but now I'll find something to place on the sides and wide loaders. I want to try and stop lots of mud hitting the bags as I'll end up unclipped them and carrying them into the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First trip - to the post office to collect the mail. Picture above is outside the post office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does it ride on the road - really good. Lots of gears - though didn't need any of the low gears here. Need to find some hills to test that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-06-18-image0.jpg" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After riding about for a bit, I then returned to the chain guard. I need to replace my grandmothers bucket tomorrow.  I cut the bottom off it and placed it over the crank. I cut to more slots out to enable the base to sit as flat as possible against the frame (See the photo below). Its held in with two cable ties. Ideally, the distance up from the bottom of the bucket would be the same all the way around, but because the bucket is a bit soft, it doesn't sit vertically. I put the crank on, and slowly cut bits off until it could turn freely. Just cut anything that hits the crank arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-06-18-image1.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-06-18-image1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the photo on the right, you can see the slots cut on the back, to help the base sit flat. Cut some slots for the chain and it was done.  Tomorrow I'll sort out the chain runs. Going to go look at poly tubing again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guard isn't finished yet. I want to place a disk (I didn't want to upset people by taking another bucket) over the outside of the crank - so there is less of a gap, and to help that bit more with keeping pants clean. I tried with some long slacks on, it does a good job of keeping pants from the chain as it is. The bucket should be cheap - a harder plastic bowl may be better. Now I have a template to start with. I'm still thinking of other options. See what occurs to me tomorrow. I'll be going on a longer ride to the local town. Will be about 30+km round trip. Thinking time, and see how the bucket holds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heres another shot - it does look like it would do a wonderful job of keeping water/mud from the front wheel off the chain. Probably need to paint it - I'm not sure how long it would last in the sun otherwise.  Depending how long, and the cost of a bucket, it might stay the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Longer ride</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/06/2010-06-19-longer-ride/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-06-19T18:17:00+10:00</published><updated>2010-06-19T18:17:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-06-19:/posts/2010/06/2010-06-19-longer-ride/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Clocked up 40km today - would have done more, but the bottom bracket was unwinding itself and of all the tools I took with me, I didn't take the crank puller and bottom bracket socket.&lt;/p&gt;

. Annoyingly the front light provides the stop at the moment. I don't want to break the light. Bought a spring - but found it was too stretchy when I mounted it.. Will return it Monday  and try the stiffer one that I discounted as being too stiff. I'll also add a bracket around the light, to stop it hitting the frame - if the fork does turn around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Go-Getter bag is great. It swallows everything - from a bucket, to lengths of pipe. I did mess up a few tight spots and scraped wide loaders or the bag. That will resolve itself as I get used to the extra length.

&lt;p&gt;Rode a few km on this trying to hit every puddle and mud spot I could find. So far its going okay. Going to hit some dirt roads tomorrow. Corrugations, clay soil, and with the rain up here, will be good an messy. A chance to see what is going to work loose, and if the chain guard really does that much for keeping the chain clean. It does keep the chain of long pants though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still tossing up if to mount a basket on the front, or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried a few more options for the deflopilator. Not really happy with that still. Its not the flopping that is the problem - its the light being hit. Getting a longer bolt to place a metal bracket around the light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like a basket, but my handle bars don't seem to have much space. My current thinking is to use the two bolts and attach two small buckets(?) to the sides under the handle bar. This will give me space for small items and not interfere with the light, or with me seeing the front wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding about because its fun, and to test out chain guard, and find what wants to work loose. I think the chain guard is a winner. Looking at the amount of mud/sand/water splashing on the outside and on my feet, the chain is as clean as when it went on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been after some Corflute for a while. Haven't found anyone that sells it up here, but today, out riding I found some. A large sheet too! Today was windy. It was interesting riding home with this sheet - it alternated between anchor and sail modes. Most of the way was anchor :( Glad for the Yuba - was easy to tie it on the back - and pedal. Would have held it and rode one handed on the MTB. Go Yuba!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-06-24-image1.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-06-24-image1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also acquired a piece of aluminium (6x60x300mm) and spent time on the hacksaw and file. Made one spanner for the headset bolts. The reason for the 'h' shape, is that I want to have a thick handle on the other spanner to use as a chain whip. 3 tools from one bit of aluminium. With these tools, I can do all maintenance and repairs. A wide jaw 6" shifter opens wide enough to go over the bottom bracket socket. It will also work on the Rohloff sprocket nut, and all other nuts on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also found the right tension spring for the
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px;"&gt;
deflopilator.  Its not the length that was important - its the tension - enough to pull the fork to center, but still have enough stretch to let the forks turn as far as you need them to, without over stretching the spring.  Its on now, but will change the mount when I get a longer bolt.  I'm not keen on rusty bolts - so all the bolts that I'm responsible for are marine grade stainless steel socket heads.  Makes life easy - no rust, and Allen keys.  There are a couple of bolts with nuts on the end - the front mudguard and light mount is one.  New bolt is on order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wandering about the hardware shop for the spring, I found right angle grease nipples.  Going to fit these on the end of my pedals to lubricate the pedal bearings.  This will involve drilling a hole, and tapping the plastic cover that hides the nut at the end of the pedal axle.  One of tomorrows tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've Shimano 324 pedals - SPD cleat one side, flat platform the other. I removed the cage around the pedals first. Drilled a hole in end cap 7.5mm wide. Used 8mm right angle grease nipple - and just screwed it into the hole. Refit the cage, and there is about 1mm gap between the cage and the nipple. When the grease is pushed in, the cap wants to pop off - but hits the cage 1mm later. I'm leaving it there. The whole job took less time then I've spent in the past trying to force grease into the pedal. Greasing the pedals is now soo much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Added slash guards to the end of the mudguards. That bucket is coming in handy. Front guard, I'm not sure yet of the attachment - at the moment its hanging on with two bits of wire. Will see how it works riding before probably using cable ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried also to make a disk for the outside of the chain ring out of the remains of the bucket - but the curve of the bucket defeated me in the end. Need a flat piece of plastic. Still one piece of bucket left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the excitement yesterday on the Corflute - and decided today not to use it. The sign is thick, has more weight than I'd like, but mainly it will interfere with access to the hub. Instead of this, I'm thinking to get some nylon type fabric. This will not hold water, should be lighter than the Corflute, and let me be creative with where it is placed. By tying it on in a few places, I'll still be able to access the hub without having to undo bolts. The main aim of it is to reduce mud splashing onto the Go-Getter bags, so they're not as filthy when I take them into the tent at nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made another 'h' spanner today and put a length of chain on the handle for a chain whip. Not 100% happy with the chain whip part. But used the two spanners to tighten the head-stem nuts - so proving that they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action shot time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blury picture of the grease nipple fitted. Didn't totally remove the cage - just the two outside bolts, and loosened the other two to swing it to the side. I left the nipple pointing slightly forward and is up towards the cleat side of the pedal. The cage is lower on that side. I wanted to use the platform side, but then there isn't much room to get the grease gun in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got enough grease in there now. If I can find a road racer tube, I want to see if it will go over the seal end of the pedal. That seal isn't the best on these pedals. Any help it can get would be good. Will hunt about for a length tomorrow when I visit the not so local bike shop. A thought I just had now, was to use a bit of coke can aluminium. Might try that first - coke cans are common, and means I don't have to take the pedal off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front splash guard showing its bucket origins. It can swing on its attachment point. Not sure yet if it will swing too much when riding at speed and be useless. If so, will weight it a bit. Also want to check if it will be a problem when going through pot holes. A piece of truck tube might be better here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rear splash guard - not so obviously a bucket bit. My rear guard is just a bit short, and the light gets coated with mud. Not good. The splash guard should stop that. At the bottom is a piece of 19mm water pipe inserted in the end of the Mudo frame. It plugs the holes, and I have a vague idea of using it to attach a piece of  Corflute to - to extend the mud guard all the way down. I need to find a thinner sign first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I thought you were on the driest continent on earth!  I like the syringe idea- you could carry one of those with you, whereas packing a real grease gun is a bit much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have also seen people extend their fenders (mudguards) by slicing a cheaper cycling waterbottle in half. (only the yuba logo would be upside down then.....)Best,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not carry a grease gun. Easy enough to find a workshops/service station with one. The pedals only need greasing about once a year. Carrying a syringe of grease would also have be a problem - most grease that I've seen for sale, is in containers larger than a syringe. Too much hassle for a once a year lube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia is the driest continent, but right now, I'm in the middle of the wettest areas. Nearby Tully has an average annual rainfall that exceeds 4 meters. Record is over 8 meters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really enjoying all your progress and ingenuity. Side boards on my mundo do make getting to the the hub and brakes annoying (I use an electric screwdriver to make it a bit easier). Soft and light sounds good. My wooden boards are great but the brake side one interfered with my disc brake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the front mudguards you may have checked my blog on it (there's a link to a more elegant solution too)  keller74.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/mudguards&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did check out your blog. But found that I didn't have a problem with the front mud guard. I've a longer bolt, and a spacer. The mud guard mount goes around the caliper and mounts where it  should. I'll get a picture to make it clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided not to go with the boards - using a tarp.  No sewing required, light, water proof and cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided not to use cloth around the Go-Getters. That would involve a lot of sewing - edges and eyelet holes. Although I've a 5000m of thread. I don't want to wait about here to get all that done. In a moment of thinking - bought a small tarp. Cost less than $4. Promptly doubled its value by putting a few more eyelets around the edge. Its big enough to go over the rack, down the sides, and up a short way on the outside.  There is also a bit to cover the ends. I'm thinking to run a string through the eyelets and use some ocky straps across the top to hold it all together.  I haven't tried it with the bags yet (tomorrow), but it looks like it will do the job of keeping mud of them. I can also use it as a rain shelter when not riding. When I ordered the frame and got the Go-Getters, I did think about using a tarp then - kind of like the Xtracycle Freeloader bags. Wasn't sure, and the Go-Getters were a great price, and they are huge!!.  I like being able to open the top and dump Stuff in. Shut the lid and its  water proof. The Go-Getters are well thought out - with buckles, and bits of velcro in the right places to pin extra strap up off the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also decided not to cover the chain any further. If I put a disk on the chain ring, there will only be a couple of inches of chain free at the rear cog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used a piece of water pipe found on the side of the road to stop the fork swinging right around and bashing the light. Its cut so that the wheel can be almost at right angles - something that shouldn't happen riding. The spring under neath keeps the wheel straight when the bike is on the center stand. Still having problems with that spring - the extra long hoses push the wheel slightly to the right - no much, but precludes hands off riding. Changing the location of the hoses helps - but will wait until I can shorten them before playing with the spring again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found a Red Bull can on the side of the road - used that to make some sleeves around the seal on the pedal. Red Bull cans are very thin. The join is is made like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
  _________  
  \  
   \  \ 
 ______\ 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When squashed flat - its secure against popping open. Cause to take the pedals off - it has to be pulled off. Tins are common along the road side. Use scissors to cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-06-26-image2.jpg" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chain guard does a great job of keeping mud off the chain. All this would have ended up a grinding past on the chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Meg. I found your blog as I was searching ways to tune up my Yuba Mundo for a long bike tour. My destination is central asia "stans". I've only one and half months to repare  myself and the bike before I go. I don't have fancy components but your blog still has a lot of valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example your experience with Go-Getters was that they are too big. Good to know that since I was allmost going to buy them. Now I'll buy Ortlieb packs that are half the size. I'll also buy heavy duty rims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up my own blog, it's called endless-upphill.blogspot.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'd like to say that I'm well organised, and everything is ready to just pedal off after breakfast this morning, but I'm not. This morning will be the quickly throw everything in to the Go-Getters. Fill the water bottles - not that much. Going to peel a few coconuts that are here - only thought of this last night. Say goodbye to family. Endure the usual - why don't you catch a bus/train/fly routine, etc.. I expect to get on the road by mid morning. Later than I'd like - but things to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today is down as mostly fine - but all the forecasts have showers from tomorrow for further than I'll be travelling in the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road ahead is pretty much all up hill. Heading up the Palmerston highway towards Ravenshoe. There will be detours on the way, so not expecting to get there super quick. Unless my detours don't exist. Yep - Google maps isn't 100% accurate. Telling my brother the back roads I was planning on taking yesterday - he let me know that they don't exist any more - bridges gone, roads fenced off, or plain no road to start with. Actually this last is true - looking about here Google maps shows roads that I know aren't there. But we'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More updates from along the way...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger of the large Go-Getters is that you can fool yourself into leave packing until the end, thinking that you can throw it all in the bags. And you can. However, the packing doesn't get that much scrutiny with this method. On checking during the inevitable repack on the road I found that I had things that should never have made it onto the bags in the first place -&amp;gt; metal files, spray tins of paint, large squirt gun tubes of glue, saws, more than once set of some tools, rolls of leather, etc. There were bags wrapped in plastic, that I wasn't game to open, for fear of what I'd find inside them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-07-01-image1.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-07-01-image1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such large bags, everyone feels that you have space to carry - well everything. I had planned to take some back roads, figuring on about 4 days between towns. I had some pasta, soup, dried peas, sultanas for this. I stopped and repacked when it started to shower - as I'd just left bags sitting on the back rack. I ended up with over half of one Go-Getters filled with food! This is an insane amount for one person. Not only that, but some of the stuff was straight out of the fridge - damp - wrapped in plastic, in panniers, in the sun (when it appeared - always when creeping upwards), was making for a soup. I consumed way more than I wanted that night and next morning, trying to avoid mould, and to free up space. I don't think you can claim lightening of the load, when you eat it... I still had stuff that went back in the fridge when I returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sun when it was out - I had a thermometer, it hit close to 40 before I noticed and put it under cover. Humidity was up there - I was a mass of sweat. The day was a mix of showers, sun, showers. I didn't bother with wet gear - was wet enough from sweating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is the chain tensioner which is causing problems. It had been behaving without a problem in test rides, but it didn't play well with the loaded bags. Something was slipping/jumping. I don't think it is the hub - as it has never skipped before, and has 3000km on it. If I pretended I had a single speed - the chain would not skip if I was travelling slow enough, no matter what the gear. Chain skip occured more in the higher gears than the low. The low gears, I had to be spinning crazyily to have it happen. My thinking is that at the faster speed, the road bumps gave the chain that bit more bounce, to press outwards just enough enough to jump a tooth or two. I've taken the chain guard off to see better what's happening - but that far back, its hard to see. I tried to simimulate the problem pedalling with the front brake on - but unless I go fast enough, there isn't a problem.  So, going to change the chain tensioner to the two wheel versions. This will cause the chain to hang lower, destroying my nice chain line, but such is life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update this morning: I went for a ride with the usual ride stuff on and had no problems - much as I tried. Returned and had someone sit on the back and watch while I pedaled, then we swapped. Me pedaling,  it would skip. Hard to tell what it is though. When I was on the back, it only happened a couple times. Neither of us could see the chain jumping  - but it is hard to tell. Feels like and sounds like its jumping a link. I do have a half link and a joiner link, but it can happen too often for it to be those two links - which are at the same spot. Need to be moving to have it happen. Going to change the tensioner, change the chain - remove the half link and the joiner link, change the oil in the hub. See what that gives. Hope it isn't the hub, but still think that it can't be - its given 3000km of trouble free usage, though admittedly, I've probably not loaded it with 80kg plus of weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no denying it was a heavy load. For instance, with all the food only in one Go-Getter, I could not pick it up one handed. Thats before adding on the tent, tools, junk and water. The bags fully loaded - were a struggle to even pick up. But I wasn't out of space to stack more stuff on if I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did it handle - like a dream (not the nightmare ones). Yes you could feel it was heavy - I used low gear lots - just sit and spin. Skipping chain helped with this - I had to resist my temptation to push harder gears. It bounced happily over railway lines and pot holes I didn't manage to avoid. It didn't feel unstable. There was no flex - standing an pedalling was - well, just like standing and pedalling on your bike. Better than my MTB with rack and gear - the rack used to sway. No sway here. Downhill speeds of just over 50km/hr didn't present any problems either - stable at speed.  A benefit of the weight I think is that semitrailers and B-doubles didn't blow me about.  The upright seating is a real bonus - much easier on my arms and shoulders. Though, for only two days that isn't saying a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the end I had the choice of pushing on for a small town to sit and wait for a different chain tensioner, or retuning to base (so to speak). It seemed a better idea to return.  It was it was downhill, I could off load the stuff on my family for them to use, and the local council helped with my choice. They were spraying from the camp ground up the road. I spent some time waiting for them to get away, but after pedalling up for a bit, I caught up to them. Then they stayed just infront of me.  I didn't want to breath poison spray all day following them. So turned downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One nice thing - riding along, looking over the side into the water - saw a platypus swimming along.  Only got to see it as I was going slow along the edge of the road. No chance of any motorist seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey Megan.  Good post.  Ohh, to be cruising around Qlnd listening to Redgum bootlegs on your walkman.  Gosh, dating myself now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like the Go-Getter bags are awesome: One just has to adopt minamalist behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could your skipping problem be because you fit a new xtra long chain to the Mundo and retained the old cog on the Rolhoff hub?  What happens is as the chain stretches the chain and the rear cog wear in together, if you fit a new chain without replacing the cog you get a skipping effect under heavy load.  New chain, new cogs.  New cog for those lucky enough to have internal gears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was wondering this also - the chain is one new, one that was on the MTB. It had slight wear. I will try this though. Getting two new chains is easy enough. Can reverse the Rohloff sprocket and the front chainring also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did an oil change on the Rohloff yesterday. The oil out was dark colored. The one that went is is clear. So not sure what this means in the scheme of things. Haven't tested if this helps yet, as afterwards I didn't have anyone around to provide a load. Unloaded its no problem. So will ride into town today and get two new chains and try again.&lt;/p&gt;

Cheeky Transport &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt; for http://www.cheekytransport.com.au&lt;/sup&gt;
to see if they had any further suggestions on the plan of attach, and to give them the heads up if didn't have any joy after trying on my own.  I also talked with Maria at
&lt;a href="http://www.rohloff.com.au/"&gt;Rohloff Australia&lt;/a&gt;
She was very helpful; suggesting what to look at that have caused people problems in the past; chains, sprockets, joiner links, overly tight or loose nut tensions,  etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slipping I'm having only happens with heavy load on. It didn't happen when I had the hub in the MTB touring. One reason I'm still going to change the tensioner and look at chains and sprockets. On the MTB I didn't run a tensioner- having slotted dropouts, so could move the wheel back. Load on the MTB rack was probably in the 40kg range. I figured my two loaded Go-Getters were in the 60-80kg range. My helpful body load is over 100kg. He wouldn't say how heavy he is, but was socked when I asked if he is  less than the 200kg Mundo rack limit. He assures me he is :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result: I'm going to try all the easy stuff first; changing the chain tensioner to a Rohloff one. I'll  get two new chains,  no half or joiner link, and new chain ring and sprocket. (well swap them around). If that gives no joy, then will send the hub back to Rohloff to have a look at under warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracked down a torque wrench and spent some time this afternoon checking bolts that I've touched on the external gear mech, OEM adaptor plate, and axle nuts. Found I had everything too loose. Wasn't that surprised on the smaller bolts - I was worried about doing damage making them too tight without the torque wrench. The axle nuts - I was surprised how tight they get done up. I've had problems with the nuts working loose before - so guess now they are tight. Will wait for the tensioner and new chains before trying a heavy load again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also had a go with the oxy - and plugged up one leak in the frame. What's this about? I put all stainless button head bolts with washers in all the braze-on's on the Mundo - to stop water entry.  There are lots of them, which is really handy. As I was doing this I squirted some light oil in the frame. I noticed that it leaked out of two on the rack. It looked like that when the weld went around the tube, they missed by pin prick meeting up to the start of the weld. A drop of braze to plug it up. I put some more oil in after this, but found I missed sealing one of them. Will do that one again tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to waiting on parts to arrive, before testing it all. In the mean time - time to go riding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the chain tensioner adjustable for alignment? ( I don't know much about these) I could guess that alignment might be more of an issue at speed and under load. Just a thought. You'll figure it out I'm sure.&lt;/p&gt;

arrived today. Its a much stronger item then my last tensioner, and it gives a lot more chain wrap around the sprocket. My last tensioner feels like a tired rubber band compared to the Rohloff one. The Rohloff tensioner comes with spacers to adjust the alignment; so the wheel on the tensioner ends up directly in line with the sprocket. Two new SRAM 9 speed chains, bit of playing with the length to get the jockey wheel in the right location according to the docs, and I was done. Short ride about all is good. Throw 120kg on the rack and same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had talked with
&lt;a href="http://www.rohloff.com.au/"&gt;Rohloff Australia&lt;/a&gt;
about this before, so packed up the whole wheel and posted it off. Lots of bubble wrap around the hub, with tape to keep it on. The wheel was left on also to help the rim. I was surprised
&lt;a href="http://auspost.com.au/"&gt;Australia Post&lt;/a&gt;
would would handle it. Glad they did. If the item is too large to sent via
&lt;a href="http://auspost.com.au/"&gt;AusPost&lt;/a&gt;
, your in for a job finding someone to send it. I found that none of the courier companies up here - TNT, IPEC would just take a parcel off you -&amp;gt; you need an account first. Obviously your not going to have one unless your sending parcels regularly. One guy suggested checking with the buss companies. Yep, buss companies handle freight. With an extra $9.90 for courier delivery at the other end. So if your stuck - check out the busses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'll be sans bike for a few days, got the spray can out and touched up the paint job from my brazing efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Advertising and Perceptions</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/07/2010-07-07-advertising-and-perc/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-07-07T08:40:00+10:00</published><updated>2010-07-07T08:40:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-07-07:/posts/2010/07/2010-07-07-advertising-and-perc/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/2010-07-07-image0.jpg" &gt;

I, and I wasn't alone, was thinking they where, but I arrived early one morning and met the guy restocking. Not so local bananas after all. He has a route restocking several road side stalls each day. Ripened bananas from the store room. I recall that he said the bananas did come from somewhere in the Far North Queensland area, but not the near by fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, your getting better value than the large supermarket stalls. I wonder how it pays though; The bananas sell at $2/kg. He has to buy them from a farmer, pay transport to get them to the store room, the store room running costs, costs of driving around stocking the stalls. How does this work to be economical to sell for $2/kg?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bicycle shorts: I don't use padded shorts, but the el cheapo KMart 'cycle shorts' also called gym wear. Recently was forced to actually buy a new pair, rather than finding a second hand pair. Lots of stickers on the product: "Moisture wicking fabric". Cynical me, checked the labels of the new versus the old; both the same  95% cotton, 5% elastane.

&lt;p&gt;The road is very straight. 2.5 hours of slow, into the wind, gradual climbing.  Who said out here was flat?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke about midnight. Thought i heard an elephant.the park at Alpha had a sign saying no camels or elephants. I know there are feral camels, but elephants? Whats and elephant sound like. At night, in a tent in the middle of nowhere it sounded like one to me. A few sleepless hours wondering, before i drifted off into sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lady at the shop in Jericho said it was likely a bull or deer. There aren't any elephants loose that she knows of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jericho is nice. Small and friendly. Going to stay here a few days for the rain to pass. And do voting here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Rest time</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/08/2010-08-19-rest-time/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-08-19T17:17:00+10:00</published><updated>2010-08-19T17:17:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-08-19:/posts/2010/08/2010-08-19-rest-time/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/19082010-781337.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some times were good. Cruising along on the edge of a sand ridge, sliding down slightly cushioning out the corrugations. Grab to much sand though, and its wipe out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostly it was hard work. Walking, pulling and pushing the bike along. I was glad when the sand stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was some hard clay bits. A worry if it rained. Lucky it didn't. But the thought did keep me awake. Well the roaring wind probably did more. I'd camped in a ditch- that helped lessen the wind on the tent, but not the spot to be if it rains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mail only comes here 3 times a week. The place is almost a ghost town, except for the grey nomads. $2 a night, $10 a week camping with a hot shower. I'm told some stay so long, they grow gardens. Cause when the heat arrives they all leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was cold yesterday. I had to set up tent and get in to warm up. Then it started raining. A very reluctant post of rain. Not alot, but enough to dampen everything. When i left the tent, i made my introduction to the local mud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've known chewing gum that sticks less! I get 2 inch platform thongs walking ten meters. Thong straps are straining. Crickey. Haven't tried to ride in this. Going to stay here the week and hope it dries up. Birdsville track is closed- to much rain. So that rules that out for now.

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to get both rims rebuilt on wider and stronger rims. That will take some time, as i'm in the country. (There is a mail truck twice a week.) Until that is done, i've got a job: truck driving. I'm getting to see the road from up high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its an old truck. Patience with the gear changing is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm moving sand at the moment; Drive to point A. The truck is loaded. Drive to point B and empty it out. Go back to point A and repeat. Interestingly i'm finding it peaceful work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also been helping out with the usual computer problems, but truck driving is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was a trip to Windorah. I became a liquid waste management expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, i drove a truck. Known as the "poop truck".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeap, i pumped shit. Tanks in the ground fill up, someone (me today) drives up in a truck with a large tank, and a pump.  Put hose from pump into the tank, and pump until truck tank is full. Drive to a remote dump point and open value to empty truck tank. Avoid all contact with liquids, and stay upwind. Repeat until ground tank is empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been meaning to comment on  using the Go-Getters for touring for a while now. Time to do it. They are huge! But, i think that they are not the best for touring.  This is my experience so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not 100% water and dust proof. The lid folds over the bag opening. I've not been able to get it to a state that i'm happy with in dusty conditions, or that i'd trust it in driving rain. In rain i'm having important stuff in plastic bags. This is annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dust sticks in the weave of the fabric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they might be mean't to be used with running boards and side boards. I'm not using either, and have found that the braze- on points, with button bolts in them are wearing the bags out. See the holes in the bottom of one bag in the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clips are not easy to operate, if your taking the bags on and off daily. I have ended up using two hold points on each bag-the inside two. The outside two are used to attach the shoulder strap. The shoulder strap makes picking up loaded bags easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that i cannot stuff goods into them in the same way as using roll top bags. If i stuff them too hard, the lid has a larger gap which has me worried for water and dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bags sit on the wide loader, which is lower than the wheel axle. This is good for center of gravity, but the down side is that i've scrapped the bags on rocks, stumps, and road kill. They now have tiny holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bags are weighty on their own. This is more in comparison to roll top bags. The fabric is thick and should last ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both shoulder straps broke the adjustment bit of plastic. Since this is one attachment point, both are now tied onto the bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll be getting some roll top plastic bags. Ortlieb make some. I'm considering removing the wide loaders, and attaching some core flute on the sides of the rack. The two bags will them be hung in a cloth sling on the side. This will place them above the axle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll have to visit a larger town when mobile again to get the cloth, well probably canvas. I'll have a photo then. It may be easier to understand then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll be similar to the Xtracycle cargo bag- the Freeloader but made from canvas..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll not see that for several weeks yet. I'm estimating 3 weeks until my wheels are back. Then another week to get to a large town and buy stuff.I'm currently a long way from anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

If i can fit it in, it's going to washed by the machine. Still there are lots that don't fit. So hot water, soap, rubber gloves and scrub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last day doing things in Stonehenge. Was helping cut the law on the ride on. Never used one before. I managed to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the bottomless pit (in fairness it wasn't marked, and was hidden in the knee high grass)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cut the water pipe (plastic also hidden)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am now in Blackall. Was a long hot ride from Stonehenge to Isisford. Rolled in on 7pm after leaving at 4am. There was stops during the hot part of the day, and lots of rest stops after that. Slept several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isisford the river was over the bridge. Walked that pushing the bike. Lots of mossies and sandflies about right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still having lots of hassles with bags. My blue waterproof bags are that, but getting them on the bike hasn't been as successful as i'd thought it would be. Thinking now that panniers, the tried and tested touring gear carriers are the go. My gear at the moment is held on with lots of straps and ocky straps. Looks big and messy, and is a pain to get on and off the bike and to find anything. Am sitting the blue bags in the yellow Go Getters. It the blue bags are upright, they tend to fall outwards. Lie them down and opening them without unpacking is hard. Tried putting different amounts of gear in them, and in the Go Getters. Haven't found a combination that works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fatter tires are way better. They provide some suspension, and track better on the dirt roads.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Jondaryan</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/10/2010-10-12-jondaryan/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-10-12T07:09:00+11:00</published><updated>2010-10-12T07:09:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-10-12:/posts/2010/10/2010-10-12-jondaryan/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/12102010043-765772.jpg" &gt;

Ended up going down roads that turned into dead ends. Some had fences across them - suggesting that they might have been open once..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was good being out in the country smells again - grass, gums, and cows. No road kill yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Checked out all the cemetarys I passed. Lots of dead people, passed awy, some are resting, others were "called" (Why do they answer?), some "gone to a better place" (What didn't they like about this one?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day was overcast, and warm. Spent three hours eating lunch and reading. Then started being more serious about getting somewhere. With a full stomach, it was slow pedalling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped for a drink at a fence gate, and one of the few cars I'd seen stopped. They owned the paddock and were going to do some fencing. We talked for a couple minutes. They offered that I could sleep on their property. So I cycled in after them and helped them with the fencing. As we were moving along the fence, I found the best spot to camp. Little stream trickeling in the background, lots of birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woke up this morning to birds singing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictures; Tried different packing strategies. The great outdoors!! A model of a church that once existed in the cemetry. (Wonder if the church had problems with snakes?) The morning tent view &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a week it has been..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a week it has been..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped a couple of days outside of Aratula. The second hand shop there, the guy gave me a book, so  I had to stick around to read and and drop it back. While there, I saw a koala in the wild!!!! The koala climed down one tree, ran across the ground and up another tree. Did this a few times before finding a tree it was happy with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After leaving, it was a two day climb up over the range. The road I picked had signs saying no trucks, semi trailers, caravans or busses. Some of the grades were 17%. Needless to say I walked lots of it. It would have had great views, but mostly I was struggling to see more than 20meters - fog or mist or clouds. It was cold and wet, wet, wet.  It took two days to climb the range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped in Legume, and Liston for a night each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently in Texas staying in the caravan park.  Yes. There is a town called Texas in Qld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memorable moments;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a tree falls in the bush does it make a sound? You bet. At 9:15ish at night, I went from sleeping to crouched ready to run in one heatbeat. A very loud "crack", followed by the sound of  falling. In the morning i found some small twigs had hit the tent. The dead tree fell towards the tent, but the top of the branches stopped about 10meters away..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging a hole in the rain forest is hard work - lots of roots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Killarney to the NSW border, the road is called "Border Road". at the border, in NSW the road is called Killarney Road. QLD likes having the roads called Border road. Same thing happened when crossing again on the way to Stanthorpe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas has sheep farming- lots of flies. Dig any hole early in the morning before the flies wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New top speed - 79.5km/hr. Might have been faster but i put the brakes on early on.. But then lost a water bottle the speed crept up before I knew it..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain stings over 50kn/hr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being wet each day has its problems. I wear the same clothes each day. I've only three sets: one to wear, one to sleep or change into and one spare. So if one pair is wet, and its still raining, they go back on the next day. I found that I have lots of little blisters or boils. Any small cut would easily become infected.  A day of being dry has helped them a lot. Clothes that are wet constantly smell. In short before washing today - I stunk.  Going past road kill, the flies would all leave to follow me. I had so many on me, I'd chase them off to make the uphills easier.  Fair dinkum!!!  Skin softens in the water, and I found small pills of skin in the tent. Any callouses I had are long gone.. But after all of it, one good wash and everything is gone. I smell clean again, my clothes have the soap and sun dried smell. Looking foward to sleeping tonight - a clean dry bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blue Ortlieb bags have shown a problem. The top is closed by a roll down, but the edge has a cloth strip. This strip soaks up the water and lets a few drops inside. I'm going to spray silicon on it when I get some to stop that. For the moment I'm double bagging to stop my sleeping bag getting damp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panniers on the Yuba Mundo work well. I feel like I can ride faster than with thee Go-Getters. Its also easier to pack and unpack the bike. Its also easier to push the bike up hill - the wide loader bar isn't in the way. The panniers sit a few inches higher  - which is a big help when crossing water. I walked through water up to just below the axle height. The go-Getters would have been in the water, and lifting the bike. Water that deep has a lot of force. I wouldn't like to walk through any deeper flowing water...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pictures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;koala in a tree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picture taking has been limited in the wet. My phone isn't water proof, and mostly I was so wet, I didn't want to risk opening the water proof bag to get out the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all the rain - it isn't as unpleasent as you might think. It does make for some changes, like stopping earlier to give the inside of the tent time to dry, or taking longer to setup and take down the tent.. And when the sun comes out its so magical.  Riding in the rain is easier in some ways - its cooler, and there isn't any water shortages :)&lt;/p&gt;

Then stopped about 20km outside of Inveral for another few hours.. Slept beside a hay field. Oh did that smell nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm back in Barraba. But only for a short time. I was good resting here for a couple of days, but the weather is cool and sunny and I've itchy feet. Want to keep moving..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road here from Inverell was interesting. Met several wonderful people.  I'll have more on that in the new year. Emails are being exchanged, plans are being formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped at Copeland Dam briefly. The water level was down to 6%, its now at 40%. Long way till the spill ways are in use again.  The road travels along the top of the dam wall. You can see the two different height trees - the old growth, and the new trees growing on land that should be under water when the dam is full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the road was dirt - hilly and steep, meandering amongst the cows. I crossed several causeways, flowing with water high enought to get wet feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the rain, there are lots of flies, and mossies. The flies are the ones that try and go up your nose, and into your eyes. Don't open your mouth!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The land is very green and lush. On one steep hill, I got to see two Dung Bettles rolling a ball of dung along. They were much smaller than I expected, but very entertaining. I just wish it wasn't on such a steep hill.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Boggabri, Mullaley</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/12/2010-12-23-boggabri-mullaley/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-23T13:55:00+11:00</published><updated>2010-12-23T13:55:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-12-23:/posts/2010/12/2010-12-23-boggabri-mullaley/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/22122010092-746579.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Didn't leave Barraba until 11:30. A very late start for me. Lucky 10km down the road was a shed. Rested there and had lunch till the sun cooled off a bit.  Lots of dirt roads, flies, mossies and cows. Very quiet on the road though.  Sorted out the flies. I've some strings hanging off my helment, that swing in front of my face. Keeps the flies out of my eyes and nose.  Took a detour to see "Dripping Rock". Yep, its a waterfall, that was flowing. Been a lot of rain lately here. My plans to have a swim were dashed but the number of mossies. Some are basically flying syringes. Standing still - you could almost feel your blood pressure dropping. No chance I going to give them more skin to feast on.  Had a flat tire this morning. It went down yesterday, but after pumping it up, I kept riding for another 40km to find a spot to camp. With all the rain here, there is a lot of water lying around on the road side. Got wet feet several times going over causeways.  Flat repair was easy, once I moved into the tent to do it. To many mossies outside. The hole looks like a thorn - but couldn't find anything stuck in the tire. Time will tell if I missed it. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Tambar Springs, Coolah and beyond the Black Stump</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2010/12/2010-12-25-tambar-springs-coola/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2010-12-25T06:02:00+11:00</published><updated>2010-12-25T06:02:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2010-12-25:/posts/2010/12/2010-12-25-tambar-springs-coola/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2010/24122010100-750600.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Black Stump! I've passed it. I'm beyond the black stump. The pic is from on side. Not sure if before or after it. It looks like a burn't branch to me actually. A plaque states there was a black stump once, but was burned down in a fire. A long with the hotel that was near by..   The black stump isn't what it once was... The silly season is in full swing, and its now a rest stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decided to stop in Coolah, as the roads are crazy busy. And for a small back road, just too many idiot about..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a sudden heavy down pour, but then it fined up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set off early on Boxing day with overcaste weather. Planned to stop in Ulan. Hit a new Top Speed: 81.86km/hr. Down hill obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulan has lots of mines. Air smelt of sulphur.  Was raining heavy when I got near there. Decided to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More driver silliness: Saw a car pulled over - but disappointingly saw that they stopped to add more rum to their drink.  A 4wd packed with young males, speeding along a rough dirt road. Bouncing, slipping or skidding, airborne, stones and water flying out the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with all my gear on the back, the back wheel can lose traction on wet clay. Most unsettling.&lt;/p&gt;

I met up with Jan when I was in Stonehenge. She was on a bus going to the Birdsville Races. She didn't get to Birdsville, because of the rain, but I didn't know that.. Stayed and chatted for some time. Ended up leaving with a bottle of Verdelho. (Had some last night - it was good. Everyone liked it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further down the road I found I missed the turn off I wanted to take. The Golden Highway was busy, with no shoulder at all. After half a km, I wasn't keen to keep going towards Jerry Plains, so turned back and ended up heading to Muswellbrook. Much more pleasant road to ride on. The only down side was the strong head wind all the way. It was a pedal down hill day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muswellbrook has City Rail trains to Sydney. But, only a few trains a day. I arrived at 4:30pm, the next train was at 9:00pm. From there to Hamilton to wait a hour for the next train towards Sydney at 11:37pm. Sydney City Rail service has a few weaknesses; no staff, no station announcements and no indicator boards. Past the time that the train was to arrive, a train arrived, and I foolishly got on it, only to find that I was heading back towards Muswellbrook. Bailed out at the next station, and rode back to Hamiltion Station. One of the first times I've used my mobile phone and Google Maps to navigate about in suburbia. The next Sydney train was at 2:38am, but it didn't arrive on time either. Arrived at Morisset Station close to 4am. Since I often wake about this time, and had had no sleep, I bunked down on the station bench until 6am for a short nap.&lt;/p&gt;

We rode a track towards Newnes. Twas a nice track. Had to unpack the bikes and carry the gear and bikes past a few obstructions. Lucky for two of us - the Yuba is a bit heavy for me to lift on my own over some things - like fence gates. Also with two, we were able to lift the bikes over other obstructions without unpacking them.  For a four day trip, I had a lot of failures in the footwear departmeent - my Shimano sandals and thongs broke. Both held together by cable ties quite successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in Sydney - have started replacing or upgrading gear. Thermarest is in for a warrenty claim - its got a large bubble in the middle of it. Might go a lighter version or foam when or if it returns.  Need to patch holes in the tent. Replaced the crank puller with the way lighter Shimano version. 5mm thick steel  knife sharpener is being replaced with a 50gm version. Folding knife that doesn't lock shut is being replaced with one with a better lock so it stays shut when it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aslo culling over weight items. 0.5kg of paper converted to pdf.  0.5kg bag of string chopped to just one piece for the clothes line. Clothes that are too worn but still carried are discard and replaced.  "spare" clothes that never been used  have been given away. Spare fuel bottle is gone. Keeping the 650ml bottle only.  Blue Ortlieb bags are gone - cut down enouth bulk to shove everything into the panniers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had 26kg when left Brisbane - thats before food and water and includes pannier weight. Will see what it all weighs when I leave Sydney next. Will be about for  couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, been a few changes over the past year. Each time I thought it was the "right" decision. What can I say - I make some bad decisions.  But am learning :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Yuba definitely rides smoothly. Nice bike for cruising along. Also works well for carrying what ever you want. No worries about the strengh of the frame. Going to miss the solid no flex rack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am currently back on my old Aluminium MTB frame. The Yuba is on ebay and has offers so it will sell. Why the change? Number of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra length touring causes me problems. About town I can't get into some lifts, going through bicycle path squeeze points - it doesn't make it. I have to lift the back wheel up and move it to make it around. This also happens on the wheel chair ramps. The weight of my gear and the bike and the length don't make it easy for me to do this. Not I'm not in town that much, but the lifting and moving it affects me even in the bush.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't lift it over a fence easily. Noticed this more on the Lithgow trip with a friend on a standard length bike. Two of us managed, but I wouldn't do it on my own. (Actually, I can't lift the Yuba easily even when unloaded.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've no hope of getting it on a plane because of the extra weight and the length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, the extra weight - noticing it more that I'm in Sydney. Places I've cycled lots. I expect to travel a certain speed and with the Yuba that isn't possible. Interestingly this didn't bother me in the country. So think its just I'm "back in the old places".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after anguishing over it for a few weeks, its back to the MTB frame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't have a scale handy to weigh it. The previous one was 200gm. The new one, about 150gm I'm guessing.  I'm already carrying the shifter for other uses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also cut off the extra strap that is not needed. Too long is just a hassle to keep out of the wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: This doesn't work as well as I'd thought on the bike. IF you set it up and load the ends, it holds well, but pull the end to tighten the load and the cable ties roll, and then slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-May-2011: EDIT: On the road, still trying to use this method, I found that if I tighten the cable ties enough, so the strap has to fold to pass through it, then it works really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ocky straps have evil metal hooks on them. Evil because the little black rubber boots on the end of the wire soon comes off, then the wire hook punctures tents, panniers, and skin easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy shock cord from Bunnings and cheap clips from a $2 shop. Tie two knots to keep the cord from working lose. Shock cord is more elastic than the ocky straps, and you can make the cord exactly the length you need.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Exped Auriga Mesh Tent</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/01/2011-01-25-exped-auriga-mesh-te/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-01-25T13:42:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-01-25T13:42:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-01-25:/posts/2011/01/2011-01-25-exped-auriga-mesh-te/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Exped Auriga Tent  3100gm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cheap Poly Green 6x8 tarp 340gm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The  blue tarp goes on the ground, then the footprint is placed on top of  that. The tent sits on the footprint. Some of my tent sites have lots of  sharp stones. The blue tarp is getting very thin now and has many  holes. I'll replace it soon. The footprint also has holes. So far the tent bottom is not holed yet, but does have some thinner spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after starting to use the tent I emailed Exped asking about UV resistance. The instructs say to "avoid prologed UV exposure". What is prolonged?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their reply was very fast: "When daily exposed to the sun the fly will have a live span of around half a year. The fabric than will be UV-damaged, easy to rip and dull color. To expand the span of life of your tent, pitch it up in a shady place take away the fly or cover the tent with a UV-proof foil, like a first aid sheet." I've followed this - covering the tent, moving it about in the shade, or even taking it down if staying somewhere for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tent has a 5 year warranty, and I had one claim on it leaking. Exped couldn't find where it was leaking, but seam sealed it again. They also said they were happy to look at the issue again if it leaked, and asked that I mark the leaking points. They also noted that they had not had problems before with leaking. I only found good reviews online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of months later it did leak again. I elected not to claim again, as I'd be without a tent for the time to send it to Sydney, get it tested, and returned. So I bought some seam sealer and covered the seams again. I also started using the green tarp to cover the top of the tent when it rains. Not sure if it is the seam sealer or the tarp on top, but I haven't had it leak since. And it has been in some very heavy rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to be very sore on this tent considering the money I paid for it. But now after looking at other tents and having used it lots of different locations and circumstances, I'm feeling very friendly towards it. I appreciate more now the features and quality in the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think my tent is "heavy" like I was initially. Consider this: the lighter weight tents are lighter because of thinner fabric. Thinner fabric isn't going to last as long, and is more prone to damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I don't like about this tent is the bag. You pack it in from the top like a shopping bag. There is no real closing for this - just a string across middle of the opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I'm giving it a UV treatment and going to add patches to the thinner spots on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present I'm using a Nokia 5800 as my main gadget. It works doing: gps, maps(on and off line), camera, web browser, email client,  ebook reader, mp3 player, radio, note taker,sms and lastly lets not forget, for phone calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So any photos are taken from the phone. Blog posts when not a PC are emailed though. Bit limited for the formating options, but one day I'll get a better phone, until then this is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Solar charger. $1 AUD coin for scale.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To power this, I'm using a small solar panel  It is book sized, and  has two 6v 400mA panels that can be used individually, or joined for 12V  400mA. Love this. While there's sun, I've power. One day I will work at  connecting the Schmitt hub up to a battery pack to gather more energy  while riding. But for now, the sun is working fine for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to only put it out in the sun when I was stopped. Recently I've been ocky strapping it on top of the panniers. By keeping the phone in the pannier and rolling the top of the pannier losely, it keeps the phone out of the dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also play music from the phone while its inside the panner. Was doing this with the music on the phone speaker, but could use ear phones if I wanted.  I don't bother playing music when riding. Only used it when walking when most of the day was pushing up hill. Singing along seemed to make the hills shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was in Brisbane, I purchased this small folding blue tooth keyboard. Its wonderful. Really love being able to type normally. If you look back on my posts, before Brisbane, they tended to be very short. With this little baby, I can type longer posts. Great for emailing friends or taking notes. Takes one AAA battery, and so far its still on the same one. Smart circuits to shut things down when its not being used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do have a battery pack (2000mAH USB connectors for charging from solar panel) than can charge the phone. But so far I haven't used it. I might not continue to carry this. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but practically, I use the phone most when its sunny, and when its raining, I don't get it out to avoid getting it wet.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Surly Troll</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/02/2011-02-05-surly-troll/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-05T09:53:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-02-05T09:53:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-02-05:/posts/2011/02/2011-02-05-surly-troll/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/05022011135-726668.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for posting the pic!  I'm putting together a Troll build very similar to yours.  Would you mind giving details of your build?  I'm especially interested in your drive train choices and your fender and tire width.  I want to use a Tubus Cosmo rack, but I'm not sure if it will fit with my Big Apple 2.35" tires and SKS 65mm fenders. Thanks, Scott&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Graham at Ridgways Cycles put me onto your blog. I'm going to follow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did a ride on Route 66 in 2012 on a Surly Troll  I bought it in Chicago. If you want a read, the blog I wrote about the trip can be reached here http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/rootedon66.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Troll is only the second new bike I've ever owned (the first was a Malvern Star tourer given to me in 1979) I still own both. I'm contemplating doing another long bike trip, but not sure when or where.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was talking with a future cycle tourer this morning, and we were going through bike bits. Whats good and what isn't.  He was tossing up what light weigh folding tire  to take as a spare for his year long trip. Luckily he had  already found the best brand:  Schwalbe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwalbe are the only tires I use. I came across them originally by chance, but now don't use anything else. Why? Simple. No flats. Well maybe not no flats ever, but darn close to that. Before Schwalbe tires, I was fast at fixing punctures. The quick stop, get tools, tire lever off the bit of tire where the puncture was, pull out the tube a bit, file tire, glue, press out the thorn/glass/nail from tire, patch on glue, press, push tire in tube, tire on rim, pump, tools back in the bag, wipe hands and cycle on.  I was fast from lots of practice with cheap tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, after a bad run of flats, I asked my local bike shop if there were any better tires for punctures. Result was Schwalbe tires.  That was years ago when I was still riding to work.  I still fixed flats - on other peoples bikes. But commuting, I didn't have another puncture. And there were times when I rode over so much glass, that I was cringing just  waiting for the tire to deflate. It never did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now touring,  I've managed to puncture a couple of times. I like riding on dirt roads, and camping in the bush. Often I'll ride off the road, across the drain and into a paddock. Sometimes the tires are furry with thorns and prickles.  Maybe this got me once. Don't know.  I  had one puncture that I don't know the cause of late last year. I suspect barbed wire.  My other puncture was from running over a tent peg on the road.  It rattled around in the spokes and frame, and then jamed into the tire. Granted the tire was worn, and maybe should have been changed hundreds of km sooner, I don't think anything would have stood up to that tent peg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently with over 7000km touring I'm very happy to be running Schwalbe tires. I like to spend my time riding,  not fixing flats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the light weight spare folding tire? What I do is just take another full tire. There isn't much weight savings on a folding tire. The folding tire isn't going to be the same as what your using each day. Even if you just use it to "get you to the nearest town" - the next town may not have the tire you want (or any tires!). So just carry a spare of what tire you use. And  of course, use  Schwalbe tires&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Rear view mirror</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/02/2011-02-07-rear-view-mirror/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-07T13:01:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-02-07T13:01:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-02-07:/posts/2011/02/2011-02-07-rear-view-mirror/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/07022011139-730378.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;As so often is the case, after trying a mirror, I now wouldn't be without one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mirror lets you see at a glance if there is anything coming behind. It doesn't replace turning your head and looking behind, but it sure does help let you know what is happening behind at times when you can't turn your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure you can often hear there is a car or truck coming. But not always. Depending on the wind, you get no warning at all. Also, while you might hear the first car or truck, if there are several,  you will not be able to tell if there is one or more from the sound.  As the first is going past, and your concentrating on avoiding potholes, or rough edges, a quick glance in the mirror lets  you know how many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a handle bar mirror, rather than a helmet mounted one, cause I didn't like the way the helmet mounted mirrors create a blind spot. But other people swear that helmet ones are best.  What ever works for you - try them both.  Get a mirror and discover how useful it is in leting you know what is going on behind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Tooth Ache :(</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/02/2011-02-08-tooth-ache/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-08T08:06:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-02-08T08:06:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-02-08:/posts/2011/02/2011-02-08-tooth-ache/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My planed date to leave Sydney is up in the air again.

&lt;p&gt;More pain and off to see a specialist today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it gets worse, it root canal treatment - that will be about $2000. Ouch. It it stops hurting, then all would be good for a while. Needless to say, I'm keen on it settling down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front wheel bearings in the Schmitt hub are gone. Was trying to think how many km they have done, but apart from the 7000 odd touring, they did service for a couple of years before that, when I didn't have a bike computer.  To get them changed is going to take a week. A place down Melbourne does them. Luckily for me, I was loaned a spare front wheel that I can use to ride about on in the mean time. So getting the bearings changed now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropped the bike computer and broke the button off. I can still change it with a small twig, and found the button. Going to try and glue it up,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else can fail/break?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been doing some more tidying up on the Troll. Yesterdays effort was a small guard to stop my heel swipping off the caliper bleed cover.

&lt;p&gt;Ended up with  9 loaves of bread, and some buns. Cause I wasn't going to eat that much so spent most of the afternoon finding people to give bread to.  Was looking for people begging, or in need. Some beggers didn't want food, only money.  Gave away all that I didn't want  in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasn't actually looking for food though. Was looking for some stainless steel to make a bracket for my front rack. I'm going to mount a rear Tubus Cosmo rack on the front.  My plan needs a small U shaped bracket. I want this to be stainless steel.  Didn't find any this time. I did pick up a handful of milling and lathe bits from one skip outside a house in the suburbs. Going to find someone to give them to tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also gathered up some clothes and dropped them in to one of the church charity bins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todays problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broken spoke on rear wheel. Not had this in years. Hoping it is just a weak spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hebie Stabilizer fell apart - well more so than it had before. There was a cosmetic bit of plastic tubing that covered the spring and attachment points - that fell off before the first photo was taken. This time the spring fell off when the clamp became loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stablizer keeps the front wheel pointing forward when you lean your bike against a post, or put the bike on a center stand.  For me, it also stops the front light I have mounted at the top of the fork, being bashed against the frame. I had one on the Yuba, till my spring broke. (I got a spring from the hardware store. Yuba sell a spring, that is probably way better suited than the one I used.) The Yuba has a drilled mounting point on the down tube.  The Hebie uses a "one size fits all" clamp. It was good while it worked. It looks like the strap that goes around the down tube slipped when the plastic coating softened. I know we have had some hot weather here lately, but was it that hot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I removed it as there didn't seem to be much point keeping it on. Looking at how the clamp works, I'm not impressed.  Its also marked the paint:(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this time I wouldn't recommend buying a Hebie Stabilizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I found the spring! That was a bit of luck. So have it on with a cable tie for now. And I cable tied one end of the spring on so that it cannot fall off and get lost again. The cable tie will not be a long term solution. If I keep this, then I'll be looking for a better clamp. Means I'll be making my own up. If I do that, I'd go to all stainless steel or aluminium fittings so they don't rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll wait until I have my front rack fitted, because then I'll be moving the light to another location. Stopping the light getting hit was my main reason for fitting the stabilizer. On the Yuba I had a piece of water pipe around the light to protect it.  The light is plastic - repeated hits on the frame would not be good for its long term health. I like my light, so am looking out for it. I keep a sock on it during the day to reduce UV exposure also.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Dental Pain!!!</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/02/2011-02-14-dental-pain/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-14T13:03:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-02-14T13:03:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-02-14:/posts/2011/02/2011-02-14-dental-pain/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/14022011155-732859.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;I survived the weekend. But it wasn't easy, or something I'd like to do again. I was sitting at the door to the dentists this morning before 8am waiting to see if I could get for an apointment. I was contemplating using pliers myself. The pain was agonyising. No matter how much I told myself pain isn't real, breath, think of something else - it didn't work. Drugs helped I think, but not enough. What did people do before Dentists and pain medication? (I suspect the pliers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forget about worrying which tooth it was, I wanted them all out. Nothing so drastic yet, the suspect from last week did have a crack in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, the pain continues, but wether nerve death, drugs or plain exhaustion its a bit less than the weekends levels. I'm told that it continue to go down now and in a couple of days not hurt at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While thinking about that, did lots on the bike. A rear Tubus Cosmo rack can be mounted as a front rack. This is great as it has a platform and is light; about 700gms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made up a bracket to mount the light above the front rack load. Need to get the wheel back to see how good this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some photos of the bike when I stopped in the park for a repack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surly isn't as rigid as the Yuba. First ride fully loaded was almost like a piece of noodle - cooked, not raw. But this turned out to be the load not firmly fastened. With everything tied down good, it still has some flex, but handles fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worryingly, the tooth is hurting more than yesterday.  I'm wondering if this is just all the pain killers draining out of my system. Still on antibiotics, another few days left of that course. Will see how the pain develops today if at all, and go see the regular dentist again for an appointment to pull it out. Well, still wavering on root canal or pull out. More leaning to pull it out. Both have consequences and risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still feels like too much gear on the bike, even though I ditched stuff and got lighter stuff. Though, putting the tent on the back rack with the panniers and water isn't as bad as I thought for front wheel lift. Thinking about a basket on the platform on the front rack. Would be a handy place to drop the shopping, and commonly used items for the day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Escape the City!</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/02/2011-02-20-escape-the-city/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-20T19:12:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-02-20T19:12:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-02-20:/posts/2011/02/2011-02-20-escape-the-city/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/20022011162-790858.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city just seemed too crowded. The press of people too much. So after being frozen in indecision on Thursday morning, I packed up and headed out of town that afternoon. Been camping in the bush for the three nights and will do a few more before  moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness is my tent in the bush with me in it:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike has been going good. I found that I needed to put the tent at least on the front rack to give some weight to the front climbing hills. Other wise all is as I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About the Troll: I'm running 165mm road cranks, because I like the shorter strokes. It also improves pedal ground clearance that little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back has a Rohloff hub, laced to Rigina (spelling) rims with black spokes. I'd probably to for silver spokes next time. They seemed to be thicker and don't rust. The hub gear gives easy positive changing all the time. I know you can change under load, but I tend to ease up and then change. I like the neat chain line, the low maintanence, no derailer hanging down and solid build of the wheel. Solid build because there is no dish needed. Also the cogs can both be turned around doubling their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tires are 26x2.00 Schwelbe Marathon Tour Plus, wraped up in Planet Bike Zefal mud guards. These guards are old and I haven't seen them in the shop in a long time. I think they are the best, as the clips that hold the guards in place can disengage easily. This is useful on the front wheel on bush tracks when a branch gets caught in the spokes. The clips pop open allowing the wheel to turn. The branch usually clears the forks, but certainly the mudguard doesn't scrunch up into the fork. A few minutes restores it all to as good as new.  There is heaps of clearance at the front fork for fatter tires. The rear is another story. I could go to larger tires if I put the wheel further back in the rear dropouts. Since I'm running 2.00 tires, and have the wheel almost all the way forward, there isn't a huge amount of space left. About 2.5 cm more and the tire would hit the rear stay brace behind the seat. The is a bit more clearance at the bottom chain stay brace.  The Tubus Cosmo rack has heaps of clearance, and isn't the limiting factor for tire size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can get measurements if people want of the spaces. I know that there is some info on the web on the Surly site about how large a tire can be placed. I think its 2.75 if you  have the wheel right back in the dropouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm presently running Shimano hydraulic disk brakes, but might change them to mechanical disks sometime. Since I want a front rack with a platform, the hoses from the brakes exit the levers at a bad angle, and want to project forward. A change of levers would fix this. But also the rear brake caliper bleed point is right were my foot will knock the cap of all the time. Previously I made a cover to stop this.  My hoses on the brakes are too long still and I'm not sure I'm going to get a nice neat line of the hoses at the front. Sticking out as they do, they are a concern for snagging them. Least with mechanical brakes, I can easily fix up a new cable. I don't carry spare hose and brake fluid. Something to think more about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used the Tubus Cosmo rack on the front also. I might cut the rack down a bit - where the platform bars slope upwards. When I had the spring to stop the front wheel flopping, the rack didn't hit the frame. The cable tie holding the spring broke, the wheel will flop around until the rack hits the frame. Either I make a better mount for the spring, or shorten the rack so it doesn't hit the frame.  The front wheel floping also stresses the hydraulic hoses and gear cables. I feel the gear cables will survive that better, where as I'm not feeling so good about the hydraulic hoses being twisted so much.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney again</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/02/2011-02-24-sydney-again/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-02-24T06:56:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-02-24T06:56:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-02-24:/posts/2011/02/2011-02-24-sydney-again/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/22022011171-757537.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a day of shivering in the park. Weather is cool and showery. Not the weather to have a cold wash in, or dry clothes. I need to do both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ate some Fava beans. Probably not a good seller with the name they have on the tin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slept in the park last night in my tent. Was okay. Not as good as out of Sydney, but better than the bench with security guards at midnight Was up and packed up  by 5:30 to avoid the morning joggers and dog walkers.  A spot to return to.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Schmitt returns</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/03/2011-03-01-schmitt-returns/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-01T12:05:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-03-01T12:05:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-03-01:/posts/2011/03/2011-03-01-schmitt-returns/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/01032011172-749272.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broke another rear spoke. Had the wheel checked for tension and trueness. Hope thats the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart stop moment, i dropped the Pitlock key down a manhole. Yikes!!! This was in Newtown. Luckily i was able to lift tin cover up. Down i jumped and retrieved it. I also put the cover back.&lt;/p&gt;

Dentist discussed the pros and cons of pulling it out verses root canal. So thee end of the appointment came without anything happening. Well, except talking. So, tooth is still there, root canal appointments booked for all of March. And I've still got another week to be certain to pull it out. Arrrgghhh.. Choices. Choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pros for pulling it out: cheap,  its done, can move on and deal with any problems later, other teeth could move affecting bite, more stress on other teeth, risk of damage to sinus, visible when smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons for root canal: 70% still fail. Expensive. Need crown which is also expensive. Worry about infection not being visible on x-rays, pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One argument says risk the root canal and it can always be pulled out later. This morning, I'm back to thinking pull it out,, get it over with and lets move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ordered some panniers from Wiggle in UK last Friday. Same time I ordered some other items from a Sydney based internet only shop. The UK gear has arrived. Yes.

&lt;p&gt;I stayed with some friends for a week, then left on my usual route. This time was different though - I didn't travel as far as I usually do. Maybe its the effects of the tooth extraction, too much eating, not enough exercise, an immune system upgrade thats underway (I've a cold). Probably its all of them. First day was 30km. Second day was 30km. And  was that a struggle. An hour after starting I was in survival mode: don't think, just pedal, or walk. Only thinking was to pick the next tree/rock/hill to get to.  I didn't go anywhere yesterday. Just sat about a campsite and ate, rested and read books. It was so peaceful where I was, I almost turned around this morning and went back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all the weighing up, shaving grams off small items. I left my friends house way over loaded. 8 books was the start of it, "gifts" that I needed to delay sending, the "extra" food that I bought because it was soo cheap, (and I made the mistake of shopping when hungry!). Today was able to post the "gifts" off. 4kg gone. 7 books given away, And by considerable effort, Over 3kg of food eaten. (Well that was over the last 3 days)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Troll is feeling much lighter now. I'm still carrying a couple of spares that I could get rid of. My Shimano sandals - I've a new pair, but am still wearing the old pair I patched with a cable tie. I've also a spare pair of thongs - still wearing the old pair patched with a cable tie there also. Lets see how long the old ones last..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All my gear should fit in the rear panniers. Having the front ones helps balance the weight about. It also means that any food buys, I have lots of space to carry them. Finding anyting in the bags is also easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm back in the town of Broke. Dennis doesn't live here any more, so I'm having a peaceful time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not many pictures so far. Was stuggling too much, and then just didn't feel like taking any.  Here is one of my Troll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shop in Singleton didn't have spokes or disk pads. The next town with bike shops is Tamworth. I'll be there Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Singleton was very hot and humid. Stopped at a servo to top up on water, and just as i'm leaving it starts pouring. A before lunch thunder storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road is mostly with a wide shoulder, but every so often one of the blue "watch for bicycles" signs appears. This is when the shoulder shrinks or vanishes. Bummer! Usually its not for long. Though i'm about 20km from Musselbrook and the shoulder isn't to wide now. Lots of traffic here now. Lots of trucks. But so far everyone has been good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some water entered my panniers:( I need to roll them more. Luckily the sun is out, and its blowing a gale. I should have everything dry by dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that the machinary that is working near by stops tonight, else it'll be earplugs to sleep.  Talking to a local, it has been running 3 days non stop, but it should finish today, but you never know. Lake Liddell supplies 3 power stations. The machinary is putting in new rail tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Timor</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/03/2011-03-24-timor/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-24T05:41:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-03-24T05:41:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-03-24:/posts/2011/03/2011-03-24-timor/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well the machines stopped about 5ish, but that was just to lul everyone into a false sense of security.

I woke up about 2am - what is that noise! They had started up again. With no hope of sleep - I left. A big Hi to Phil, Frazer and Brian, who invited me to their camp. Phil is chasing fish - not any fish. Carp. These are the fish every other fisherman i've met curses and throws out. Phil is only after carp. He's looking for big ones only - up over 20kg would make him really happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to Musselbrook is not that wide, but has some shoulder. Same for the road to Scone. Not much traffic as you can expect at 3am. A worrying bunch walking along the streets in Mussellbrook when I stopped at the lights. Had me worried for a bit until I could read the signs on their shirts - pest control. Shooting birds as night. I didn't ask what type the rifle was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrived in Scone at 5am. Quiet it was. Just the way I like towns. Coles opened at 6. Got some food and went to find a park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected I broke another spoke. This time I've loosened some of the other spokes. I've tried to get them all the same tension and have the wheel true. Last time the wheel was true, but some spokes felt tighter. Feeling a bit more confident this time. Hoping this is my last one. I'm almost out of spokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasn't feeling the best so hung out in the park trying to nap. But more road works. When the thumpers started, I new it was time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundy was nice, but with a wedding on, it was going to be busy. Timor was only just down the road lets head there. The road got hilly. I was feeling tired. At 6 i arrived, found a spot and just about to sleep when a car stopped. I'd picked the tennis grounds. And it was tennis night. Didn't matter I fell asleep anyway.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Woolomin</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/03/2011-03-24-woolomin/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-24T05:42:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-03-24T05:42:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-03-24:/posts/2011/03/2011-03-24-woolomin/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It wasn't great waking up.

Asking people what was there when I was in Scone, I was told: a pub, a shop, a corner store. There are a few houses, but the pub and shop have been closed so long the buildings aren't even there. There is an old church, but its closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nundle was 50km and a large climb away. 1.5hours walking up hill. Stopped in Nundle and ate fruit and veges. Rested and then thought I'd try Chaffy Dam. But ended up in Woolomin again. Love the hot chips here. Will rest here a few days and try and get this cold to clear up a bit. Its really knocking me about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a good note, no more broken spokes yet. And the wheels had a pounding with all the dirt roads between Scone and Nundle. I had started trying to be like on egg shells, but in the end, just went for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Wooloming Still</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/03/2011-03-24-wooloming-still/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-24T05:46:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-03-24T05:46:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-03-24:/posts/2011/03/2011-03-24-wooloming-still/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, still resting.

&lt;p&gt;Only surprise was one house where the dogs barked - a small white yappy rat like thing run out. I ignored that and just cruised along. But then there was a deeper bark and noise of a bigger dog running. Heart rate leaped and so did the legs. I didn't look back to see what it was, but could hear it. Heavy sounding paws, and panting breathing chasing along for a while before giving up. Phew...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near Tamworth there is a bike path, but don't be conned onto it.  It looks great at first, but stops and starts whenever the mood took the builders. Ramps are missing from streets. It has gaps infront of some houses: looks like they never got back to finish that bit. And then finally runs out a few km of garbage bin and parked cars later. Why are morning dog walkers dressed in black, walking black dogs? Stick to the road shoulder. The bike path has been like that for the past few years now. I don't think its going to ever be finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found a bakery open and had hot cross buns, just out of the oven. Waited about for the shops to open. Talked with a local: Sonja for a bit. (Plan well Sonja and do what you want to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamworth Cycle Shop on Peel street was very helpful. They made me some spare spokes. A little tool that presses the threads into the spoke. Neat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missed buy music. The first shop in middle of Peel street  I went to had lots, but the staff were very reluctant to help. So much so that I gave up asking and left. The next shop: Music P&amp;amp;B didn't have anything for me, but was way helpful. They sold out earlier; because the staff are so helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got tired of Tamworth, and headed out. Nice day, sunny and touch of coolness in the air. First day of sun in a while. Pedalled on and rolled into Barraba at 6. Just shy of 140km.  Hovered up a lot of food, had a quick hot shower, and crashed. Best nights sleep.  Will stay a few days and then continue on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>North Star</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/03/2011-03-28-north-star/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-03-28T11:11:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-03-28T11:11:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-03-28:/posts/2011/03/2011-03-28-north-star/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/27032011197-789847.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warialda - more baked beans. The information center had no maps. Sights I'd seen before apear like familiar signs. Tall silver metal silos, the turn off to North Star. A broken letter box - the end of the long flat straight, the start of the hills. Rolling hills disappearing upwards- lots of walking time.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn't actually stay there, but that is the closest name. I slept in a paddock with 100's of little mice. They kept me awake. I could hear their feet on the tent, and would jump up to scare them away. I worried they would chew through looking for food. Lots of them on the road also - measuring their lengh.(road kill)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd eaten lots at Goondiwindi and was going to have  an easy day. 100km was perhaps not that easy a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I swore I could smell chocolate milk early in the morning. Was wishing for some then. A bit down the road.. hmmmmm Round up. I'm in the country...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moonie - ouch.. $5 for 1.25liter of soft drink. I decided I needed sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of The Gums road house offered that I could sleep in their Donga (a shipping container set up like a room; used for workmen's quarters in remote areas) I don't like sleeping inside. Will do if I have to, but still not happy about it. I thought about camping outside, but there was a strong soap smell. So on I went.  Unfortunately, the road to Condamine is low on the edges and with all the rain, was water logged. Tricky to find a spot. Got showered on a bit also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The days so far have been overcaste. A gray sort of day with only a couple of short glimpses of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will rest in Condimine for a day - was the salt out of my clothes, eat up (I'm loosing weight) and let the legs rest a bit while I figure  out which way to go now. I want to avoid the coast road, but not sure if the inland route is open to traffic. Its still damp up north and there is a lot of water about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Condamine was a bust. Woke up and was lazing about, ate the last of my non cook food. Then was talking with a local. The supermarket shutdown and the only food in town is from the servo.Yiks! End of lazing. Packed up and headed to Miles to do some shopping.  I thought this would be bad for the town, but the local reckoned that no one shopped there and that the center of the town is the pub. Guess either everyone drinks within the limits, or there is no RBT out this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;30km to Miles. There isn't any point in stopping in Condamine any more I reckon. If I had of known the shop was closed, I wouldn't have stopped the night. I did was my clothes and have a shower, but had to put the still wet clothes on to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rode on and stopped the night in the same spot off the edge of the road that  I stopped at last time. Grass is higher though and more mossies. This morning had to crap in a bag in the tent. Too many mossies outside for me to want to bare my butt out there. Also the ground was very hard - rock covered by a thin soil layer. After lots of shitting in a bag, I must say the doggy bags are the best yet. No worries about holes in them and they are biodegradable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random thought: Why are trucks so brick shapped? Wouldn't they get better fuel economy by being a bit rounder?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of truck traffic out here now. Mining or drilling for gas, then moving livestock about.&lt;/p&gt;

As I ride, I've seen some go past ahead of me. Once or twice i stopped to let them pass by before I got there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrived in Theodore the next morning. An easy 40k of rolling hills. Theodore was another town that was completely evacuated in the recent flooding. Looking about its hard to find any evidence of it though. I expected to see debris in the trees, or water marks on the houses.I've not spotted anything.  A few of the shops are still shut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning where to go next. The road from Emerald to Charters Towers is cut with flood waters, and there is still more rain falling.How long before its open? Do I risk heading there hoping it will open before I arrive? The coast road has also been cut at Proserpine and Mackay, but it doesn't take too long before its open again.  I'm not that keen to do the coast road again, so may look at other options to get north. Mean while, I rest my weary legs and try and dry my gear.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Moura</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/04/2011-04-06-moura/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-06T10:12:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-04-06T10:12:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-04-06:/posts/2011/04/2011-04-06-moura/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/04042011203-785826.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stopped briefly on the Dawson River, but was too early in the day to stop. Found a camp by the side of the road in a cow paddock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My excitement for the day was running over a small live snake! Yiks!! It was on a dirt road, and I was watching the birds and not looking closely at the ground. It seemed okay and slithered off.(What was I going to do if it wasn't okay?) I put my feet back down from the handle bars and kept pedalling.  I'd seen a few as road kill during the afternoon. Lots of long grass about with the good rains. I was extra careful about my tent site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning rode on and met Karl. Karl has traveled over 46000km on his bicycle. He put my kit to shame. He only had a swag, a change of clothes, small tool kit, and water bottle. He averages 25km/hr to my 19km/hr. Neat. But I couldn't stand the noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the night in a gravel pit near Springsure. Was to tired to make it into town and the pit turned up at the right time. Gravel is warm in the afternoon, and then all the moisture condenses on it in the morning as it cools. Saw some meteors that night. Next morning the first road I came to was Meteor Downs Road. The next was Orion Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Springsure was a quiet town. Had a pack of $2 Tim Tams. Yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virgin Mountain was impressive for its rock formations. No, you cant see the virgin there any more. Aparently once there was a rock that looked like te Virgin Mary, but its since eroded away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a surprisingly good night sleep in Emerald near the main road. Put in the ear plugs and just slept well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capella has a look out just before you get into town, but I couldn't for the life of me see what your suppost to look at. The land there is flat, and I couldn't see over the crops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clermont as a town - I didn't like. I only stopped there long enough to get some food and water and then left. Slept that night in a cow paddock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belyando Crossing. 172km from Clermont and not much in between - well unless you count cow paddocks. Wasn't too bad a ride. Wind ended up being a head wind for a fair bit of the way. Bummer. Stayed the night as need a rest and its a good a place as any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broke another spoke next morning 15km out of town. Thats the first in a while. Hope this isn't going to be regular again. I was carrying 20liters of water since Clermont as I was told the creeks where empty. Well, some are, but some do have water in them. Dirty water true.  If you want water at Belyando Crossing you have to buy it. They only get rain water so if their tank runs try they have to truck in more water. Thats pricey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crawled into Charters Towers this morning. Was up hill the end and a head wind. Stopped and cooked up pasta at the first picnic area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sitting there eating I watched a 4x4 drive over the curb, across the park and stop near the play area. Maybe they felt my contempt and loathing of them, they drove off without getting out.  Why couldn't they walk the 20meters from the curb to the play area?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather is warmer up here. Showers should start soon also.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Boat on the Road</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/04/2011-04-11-boat-on-the-road/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-11T06:34:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-04-11T06:34:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-04-11:/posts/2011/04/2011-04-11-boat-on-the-road/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Riding from Belyando Crossing to Charters Towers, the day was hot and still.

About midday, I was slowly pedalling along on the idea that just moving was cooler than sitting still. Testing if riding was better than stopping, I stopped. It wasn't.. While under some shade I could see the water mirage effect looking down the road.  A semi emerged from the water and roared past. Time to get back moving. I blinked and looked again. Floating along on the water mirage was a ??? Its a boat my brain was saying. I blinked and looked a few times. Still a boat. Wow. I was in a bad way. The boat was growing larger as it come towards me. I thought maybe I should lie down and rest, drink more water, have some salt. Things are bad if I'm seeing things... Arh, sanity. It really was a boat. A really really large boat on a tiny trailer, pulled by a small ute. This boat was big! Think of a baby to the QE2. The sort of boat with a live on board crew, that the owner rocks on board for a bit of sun on the weekend. It was a big boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really suspect that it wasn't legal on that trailer, towed by that ute.  After it went past it had a sign hanging off the back "Wide Load" - yeah. It was wide too, and tall. It was also wobblying and swaying all over the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew, not my mind going in the heat. I had a drink and rode slowly on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Townsville</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/04/2011-04-13-townsville/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-04-13T18:48:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-04-13T18:48:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-04-13:/posts/2011/04/2011-04-13-townsville/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The day started late due to heavy fog.

Drivers! Met the nasty cases this day. (Some really bad moments - disappointing after so long on the road. But lets not let a couple of drivers taint all the nice ones out there.) Not just them, but it seemed most people I met were unhappy.  Had hassles getting a camp spot in Townsville - the camp option turned out to allow camping - but no tents. Arrggghhh.. By this time it was just before sun down, and I'd clocked up over 100km. The nearby caravan park - I declined politely the $28 tent site option and was abused for that. That was it. I decided to get out of Townsville. Found a spot and while I wasn't sure if I was strictly allowed to be there, no one kicked me out. Even though it was right near the road, I got enough sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a hot and humid day. Had fun with the trucks passing at one stage - the gust of wind pushed me along. Other times had a head wind and trucks passing the opposite way almost stopped me dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found a leaf blower on the side of the road in the grass. Tried to take it with me, but it was too big and heavy. Left it on the side of the road where it was visible. Saw a car stop and grab it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been resting for too long now. Feeling itchy to get moving. Time to head west!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I've been sitting about, I have been slightly active: updated the the equipment list, new Shimano sandals, new pedals, a phone holder for the handle bars, a small bar bag (actually a camera bag), a pot warmer, a lid for the pot, a chain guard, extra water bottle mount, trued up the wheels, lightened my tools and patched up some of my clothes that are showing wear and tear and other minor items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new Shimano pedals got the same grease nipple treatment as the old pedals. I expect that the top of the pedal where the cleat clips into will wear out before the bearings do. But still, being able to grease the bearings is way easy now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Removing the handles from the cable cutter cuts the weight from 290 grams to 82 grams. I have four bolts that go in the holes from the rivets, and then can use the pliers for one handle and the shifting spanner for the other. True its not as fast to cut a cable compared to keeping the handles, but I don't need to use it that often. I have cut cables without cable cutters in the past, but it isn't easy. Normal plies and cutters squash both the inner and outer cables. A grinder does a better job on the outers, but unless it has a very fine wheel, sprays out the inner wires. If it was only brake cables, I wouldn't worry about it. But the Rohloff gear cable inners need to fit through small holes. Unless the inner is cut neatly and cleanly its really hard to get them in. Sufficient to say after doing it once with the grinder, I've now got cable cutters. The weight of the tool is now minor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time on the chain guard. Bent up and cut a fair amount of water pipe and electrical conduit before using the core-flute. I wanted to have the chain ring covered, the chain in tubes and some covering over the rear cog. I did get a couple of versions to work, but in the end wasn't happy with the robustness of them. I elected to use core-flute in the end as its light, was easy to fit, and if it does get bashed too much its easy to get off. It looks a bit agricultural at the moment, but I didn't have a lot of choice in the core-flute. The sign I used, I found in the shed under the lawn mower. It was squashed flat in places, and has bends in the wrong spots - part of the reason for the chain ring being visible. It was also a tad to small for what I needed. It will do as a prototype to find how it works.  It stays in place by resting on the frame behind the chain ring, and on the chain stay. One cable tie holds it all together.  Only found two problems so far with it - getting access to check the chain adjustment means cutting the cable tie and centering the wheel is harder as you cannot see the chain stay. It has enough clearance that nothing rubs on it. We'll see how it lasts on the road.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Milla Milla, Ravenshoe, Mt Garnet, Mt Surprise</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/05/2011-05-19-milla-milla-ravensho/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-19T11:12:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-05-19T11:12:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-05-19:/posts/2011/05/2011-05-19-milla-milla-ravensho/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Finally, I've out run the wet weather.

&lt;p&gt;I left on Monday and it was fine. Cloudy but fine until I put the tent up. Since then its been damp. I stopped at Henryetta Camp ground the first night. Nice and peaceful in my tent, the patta patta of rain drops on the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day was into Milla Milla. A shower had started sometime in the early morning and after waiting for it to stop, I gave in and packed up in the rain. By the time I got to Milla Milla, it was still showering, and it was   blowing a gale.  I was so cold. Stood about in the rest area teeth clattering,  shivering trying to decide if to put a jumper or thermals on or not. Shivering you'd think I would put something on - but thhe rub was that then that would get wet also. I humed and hared about for two hours before moving on without putting any more clothes on..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took the scenic drive out of Milla Milla to Ravenshoe. Not only is it slighty shorter, its sign posted as unsuitable for caravens.  Five minutes after leaving I was warm.  The road was up and down, but more importantly it was out of the wind a lot of the time.  The area is called Misty Mountain and on the way to Ravenshoe I passed Windy Hill - which had a wind farm. Do the fans run better in the drizzle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ravenshoe is Queenslands highest town (or something like that). It was dryer than Milla Milla, but still windy and showers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent the night at Millstream Estate. Well a rest area. Lucky for me part of it was closed to vehicles, so I wheeled  the Troll through and had the whole area to my self. Bonus was that it was further from the road. Still it showered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped briefly at Innot Hot Springs . But I'm more of a warm  shower girl, and didn't get in. The only thing I wanted was for it to stop showering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt Garnet information center has just opened. I'm on the first page in the visitors book! Had a cuppa tea, and dried the bike computer on top of the kettle. Sometime around Milla Milla it started playing up, and finally quit all together at Millstream Estate. 10 minutes on top of the kettle and it was back working. Now just have to keep it dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another rest area near the Lyd Junction last night. Was helpful that the trucks sounded their air horn each time they passed. Wouldn't have known the time otherwise. But they where not regular. Someone missed the 3am slot. Still I was on the road early. Tent is still wet as - yep - it showered again. I fought a side wind to the turn off, than had a wonderful tail wind for a while. Cruising along at 30 to 40km/hr towards Mt Surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tail wind didn't last. The clouds are now difinitely here. I'll be fighting a side or head wind when I leave here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the usual pains and aches getting going again after a month off.  Not as bad as I thought it was going to be. Maybe the cold has stopped the pain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No photos so far as its just been too damp.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Georgetown, Crydon</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/05/2011-05-23-georgetown-crydon/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-05-23T09:43:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-05-23T09:43:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-05-23:/posts/2011/05/2011-05-23-georgetown-crydon/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/21052011246-714475.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of caravans and boat trailers on the road. Decided to take a dirt road that would loop into Crydon. Alias, it turned into a 120km out and back trip.The road was closed.  Was a bit annoyed that the campervan that passed me when I was heading in didn't stop and say so. Would have saved me 40km of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've noticed that there are locked gates fences up all along the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pictures for today. A genuine Aboriginal artwork on a rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its a littl known fact that Burke and Wills carried their own toilet block with them on the outbound trip. They had to abandon it. Luckily I got a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent a couple of days about Croydon.  Was a nice little town. Got a lift into town, then was sitting there thinking about the road that I missed, so rode back out to where I got the lift from, and cycled back into town the next day. It was worth it..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Croydon to Normington, there is a railway siding at Blackbull. There are water tanks there, but get this - they are kept empty to discourage people camping there. The Normington-Croydon train stops there though for morning tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normington was just a food stop for me. I didn't stay long before heading onto Burketown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leichhardt Falls are before Burketown. Spent the whole day lounging about there. And pretty much had the whole place to myself. A few caravans and camper vans went past, but only one lot got out off their car to have a look. You can't see the falls from the road. There is an access track that you can drive down  - but didn't see anyone doing that.. They missed out big time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Gregory Downs, Lawn Hill, Camoowheel</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/06/2011-06-04-gregory-downs-lawn-h/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-04T10:11:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-06-04T10:11:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-06-04:/posts/2011/06/2011-06-04-gregory-downs-lawn-h/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/02062011258-703253.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Found the gps didn't match the roads. I reckon the datam is out, as the road was always half a km off were I was. Had me worried for a while, as I took a short cut and was worried I was on the wrong road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general I found the roads from Burketown to Lawn Hill rough. The section from Gregory Downs to Centenary Mine turn off was in better shape. Go the heavy vehicles!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawn Hill was for me a bit of a let down. Its a water spot in the middle of no where. But I thought that there were nicer creeks, rivers and rock ranges on the way. The Cascade walk - the cascades are tiny. I was told later that the recent rain had changed the water cause, and so their size has shrunk.  There were other things that didn't sit right - like the aboriginal rock art. But in the end it was somewhere I rested for two nights and caught up again with Nic and Carrol. First met Nic and Carol at Gilbert River. They are English driving an english car. We've kept meeting up again and again. I thought I'd seen the last of them given my speed and route. So it was a nice surprise to find them at Lawn Hill. Had a wonderful meal with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge thankyou also to the Chris and Andrew for all the food they donated to me. I had thought to buy a top up at Gregory Downs, but there was nothing there.. I was then going to go back to Adel Grove and buy a bag of pasta to get me to Camooweel. But thanks to the donation, I had heaps of food leaving Lawn Hill. Lucky in a way, as it took me four days to get to Camooweel. I've still got heaps left. Thanks so much guys!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thank you to Russel, Malcolm and Trever - the road work crew out of Mt Isa. Met them and shared a lunch break. They also gave me the run down on what was ahead. Their hard work had made the road easier for me to ride on. Keep up the good work guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now sitting in Camooweal, full belly, thinking of where next. Decided I'm going to stick to the tar for a few hundred km. Have a rest from the rattling dirt road and get into the Northern Territory for a bit before tackling some more dirt.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Barkly Homestead</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/06/2011-06-06-barkly-homestead/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-06T16:13:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-06-06T16:13:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-06-06:/posts/2011/06/2011-06-06-barkly-homestead/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/04062011262-702528.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Camooweel to  here there is heaps and heaps of country side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first night in NT I slept near the Kaima Creek. Interesting spot. When the breeze died down at night I could smell the sulphurous creek. Actually, the next day I wasn't certain if it was the creek or some plant. Smells to me like hydrogen sulphide. A rotten smell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also during the night I heard dingos? howling. Several times. Each time nearer to my tent. Eventually they were outside. Since I had the outer clipped up- they were very close.  Smart animals they understand english. I told them to go away and they did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full belly at Camooweal didn't last long. Back starving again. So hungry these days. Inhale food time. Looking forward to getting to Tenant Creek so that I can buy up big.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Tenant Creek</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/06/2011-06-16-tenant-creek/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-16T13:35:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-06-16T13:35:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-06-16:/posts/2011/06/2011-06-16-tenant-creek/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well Barkly Homestead, while nice, didn't do it for me for a good rest.

Think I've been out in the paddocks too much. At Barkly Homestead, people walking, the generator changing tone, cars slowing or stopping on the road, trucks doing the same. Every noise I'd wake up.  In the end was up and packed up early to get away. Found out then that NT is in a differrent timezone to QLD. I didn't know till I went to hand the key back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of sleep, made for a tough day. Struggled along.  The good thing was that night I slept so well. My spot was right near the road behind some bushes. Very close actually. But such a good sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still was struggling with lack of food. Stopped twice to cook up pasta and peas. Reckon that it just wasn't enough though. The dire food situation has forced me to do something I've never done before - plan meals for x days ahead, and plan more than one meal. So, when I arrived and did the shop up at Tenant Creek, I knew that i needed 6 or 7 days food. Planned breakfast, lunch and snacks. (I don't do dinner. Last eat is late afternoon. I sleep better that way). Probably got too much food now. Will see how it works out over the next week as I head towards Katherine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big "Hi" to Terry in Tenant Creek. We met at the supermarket and he invited me back to his place for a cuppa. He also offered that I could stay the night, but I was wanting a paddock, so declined. (I slept out of town about seven km in a gully, which was good. Very windy night it was.) He has helped out other cyclists he's seen about Tenant Creek. Super helpful guy. The only person I really ended up talking with in Tenant Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random things so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the budgies that escape head west. Seen flocks of them out here. I've never thought of them as birds that live outside of a bird cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mining equipment on display at Tenant Creek looks like its for kids. Small dinky machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying more than 10liters of water most of the time. Mostly leaving a town with 20 liters. There are rest areas with tanks, but sometimes the tank is empty. Been annoyed a few times arriving to find caravan people using the water to do their washing, or washing their cars. Grrrrr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been avoiding the caravan crowd for the last few days. Tired of their whinging. They complain about the cost of fuel (just shy of $2/liter, cost of food, traffic, everything.. Aren't they every happy?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Katherine</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/06/2011-06-16-katherine/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-06-16T14:09:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-06-16T14:09:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-06-16:/posts/2011/06/2011-06-16-katherine/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Made it to Katherine today and am staying at Coco's.

They give a discout for cyclists. Well got into town and met Garry again (met him down at Dunmarra) and he'd been staying there.. So went and checked in. Very nice place. Coco is a nice guy. Love the Bantam chooks wandering about the yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shopped at Woolworths for the first time since the coast. Wow.. After the smaller stores, its soo huge.  Fresh fruit!!!  I'm in heaven..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually riding into Katherine, there is a bike path from about 10km out. Its lined with Mango trees for part of it. Pity there isn't any fruit on them at the moment..  Like all bike paths it vanishes at one point with no signs on where to go. A construction site is the cause. I rode on the dirt for a bit, then hopped onto the road. But that was the outbound two lanes from Katherine. Arrgghh.. Back on the dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride from Tenant Creek to here has been for the most part uneventful. Highway riding - cars, caravans and trucks. (Over it for now. Looking forward to finding some dirt again.) Camping in the bush.  One night, on a stretch of bush, I walked across about a km of hard clay to camp near a creek. The ground was so hard I couldn't get tent pegs in very far. That night about midnight it stormed. Wind, lightening and rain. Well the ground turned to mud. Tent pegs wouldn't stay in now.. So a long night of tent flapping. It was also cold. Being awake I started packing up early before daylight. But with the mud it was daylight before I went to lift the tent up. There was a small snake where I was sleeping. Reckon it was sleeping with me for warmth.(it didn't provide me with any!) Neither of us could get excited - it was too cold. I kept packing up and it slithered off slowly into the bushes. Since then I've been packing up later, and checking underneath earlier in the packup routine.. Oh and that km of clay, was soft as custard. It took a lot longer to get back across it with the wheels sinking to the rims..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back on the Barkly Highway, when I didn't have enough food, the Stuart has been lots easier. Still got food left from Tenant Creek, so bought too much then. But I've been eating well. It certainly made the days easier. Actually some days I rode less than four hours, and spent a lot of time reading. Much better way to travel..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have stopped at some historical sites along the way. But frankly most of them  you'd never know it. World War II sites - seems to be nothing there except the sign saying its a historic site. There could be something under the thigh high grass, but I'm not tracking about in it to look. Others like the Tenant Creek telegrath station and the over land wire line did have things to look at. Actually you'd need a week at the Tenant Creek Telegraph office to read all the material there..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stuart Highway has a speed limit of 130km/hr. This time of year,  the big migration is underway. So its busy. All the grey nomads and holidayers from down south heading north for the winter. Some of them are in such a hurry. I've heard that some of the places don't take bookings, so I guess people rush to get there in time for a space.&lt;/p&gt;

For the first time in days I was flying along. 32km/hr, down a gentle slope, with a bona fida tail wind.  Then the hard packed clay changed. The tire track I'd been following to avoid the rocks became a thin canyon with steep sides of soft sand.  Drift to far off the increasingly narrow track and I'd bog down in sand and crash..  But oh, the feeling of flying was good.. I enjoyred it while I could.. It didn't last, and it would be many days before the speed rose to even close to 20km/hr...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd left Katherine at lunch time and had a few easy days. One was particulary good, when I found a crash site. Somones camper or caravan had rolled. When it was taken away, all the stuff that fell out was left behind. Treasure!!! Found unopened food and drinks. Got a lid for my pot, a thermometer!! Ate food from that crash for the next five days.. Pity the chocolate was no go. I also had to leave the beer behind as I didn't want to carry it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also met two other bicycle riders. Philippe and Ursula (
&lt;a href="http://www.andakt.ch"&gt;www.andakt.ch&lt;/a&gt;
). I'd was still at the wreck site, hyper on food I'd been eating and so excited to finally meet some other cyclists. I probably seemed a bit demented.. They had Xtra wheel trailers. Neat trailers that worked well for them..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the food from Katherine and the food from the crash, I thought I small detour to Top Springs would be a good idea. Specially after finding Fiora River National Park closed. Top Springs - sounds good. Sounds like water...  Alas, no springs there..  The pub/inn was moved to its present site at the junction of the roads.  Actually there wasn't much of water from the highway turn off till well after Top Springs.  Okay, that didn't pan out, but I could still go into the Gregory National Park. After 40km of riding back and forth between stations and Yaralin Community, I was back on the road to Timber Creek. Yep, the Gregory National Park was closed also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone had said the road was going to be rough, and this time they were right. Two days of grinding along in sand, gravel and rocks to get back to the tar.. Was I happy to see that. More so, was riding on it..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One item of interest from Top Springs; Noel Buntine was the guy responsible for road trains of cattle.  And he was born at Stonehenge in QLD! Yeah.. I've been there...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Got to see some wild donkeys at one night camping..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the people I talked to at Yaralin were so nice. Very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found a tin of beer on the side of the road - and just threw it in the bin. Seems everyone here doesn't drink beer. Got tired or carrying it..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jasper Gorge - a "high light" of the trip from Top Springs to Timber Creek was not worth stopping at. Its a camp site, but with no toilet block. I rode in and used toilet paper was blowing about in the wind. I road straight back out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had a slow ride to Kununurra. Stopped near the border crossing and ate lots of fruit. There is an inspection station at the border, so was lots of good pickings to be had. So much so that I needed to lie down a couple of km past the crossing. Didn't make it too far before another lie down was needed. So much food..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I'm out of NT and in WA- I can say WA is a lot cleaner. NT is a rubbish dump. So much rubbish on the side of the road and at tourist spots. Okay I only went to the free stuff, maybe the pay sites have someone to pick up the rubbish. I talked to some NT people about the trash - their attitude was there is so much about a little more doesn't matter. I met people that gave me a drink of coke, and then threw the empty tin on the ground. Arrrgghh... The posters might say "pristine wilderness", but the poster writer must live in a rubbish dump. Bottles, cans, plastic, boxes, used toilet paper.. It was such a trashed place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kununurra is hot. Its back to heat and bugs.. So, going to head south on the tar for a few days to see if I can get to somewhere cooler..&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Halls Creek</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/07/2011-07-02-halls-creek/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-02T15:50:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-07-02T15:50:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-07-02:/posts/2011/07/2011-07-02-halls-creek/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/30062011276-760764.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stayed around Kununurra for the two days, and then had to get south. It was so hot and humid. My plan to ride the Duncan Highway went out the window for an easy way to get as far south as possible - down the tar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I met Max, Margarita and (not sure of the spellling) Gioragio (George). They were travelling towards Kununurra and stopped. Kindly they gave me some apples and garlic. Those apples sure tasted good.  They're travelling around Australia and are currently looking for work. Maybe I'll see them down south ways..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did feel cooler as I rode south, but its only a matter of degrees. Sitting here in Halls Creek its just below 30C and not so humid. Certainly an improvement.  The best I can do until I'm past Port Hedland in another two weeks time. Water consumption has been running about 6 to 8 liters a day in drinking. I'm sweating so much. Luckily the sun has been behind clouds the last two days. The road has been hilly -look at the map and see all the ranges about here. I wonder if a head wind would have made it cooler as I'm not travelling fast in the hills. I'm not doing so well in the heat and humidity..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you seen the Bungle Bungles? I have.  There was a good poster for them at the Doon Doon roadhouse :) In my mission to find somewhere cooler, I didn't detour into the park. The prices for a day trip were truely jaw droppping.  There are lots of things I'm never going to see in the world - the Bungle Bungles in person, are in that list..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halls Creek is a nice rest stop. It has an IGA and the caravan park is quiet. Yep - I'm in a van park. Decided it was washing time. I'd bought some veges in Kununurra and left them in the plastic bag. But in the heat they turned into a soup in my pannier. I sure wished the plastic bags hadn't leaked. Onions gone off have such a strong smell! That was the pannier with my sleeping cloths in it.  Last night my camp ended up next to a dead cow. It was just bones and I couldn't smell it when I set up  20meters away. But during the night, when I woke a few times, I was wondering what I was smelling - me, my souped on clothes, the dead cow, live cows, or something else.. So even though its overcast and cooler than it has been, I decided to stop the day and wash everything.  I'm sure that getting all the salt out of my riding gear will make it lighter and breath better to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending how I'm feeling tomorrow morning - it will be either an early start to get  towards Fitzroy Crossing, or another rest day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Fitzroy Crossing</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/07/2011-07-05-fitzroy-crossing/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-05T11:43:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-07-05T11:43:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-07-05:/posts/2011/07/2011-07-05-fitzroy-crossing/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ended up resting another day in Halls Creek.

The rotten onion smell is definitely gone from my things now. Basically sat about and ate. Found that I had a lot of food resting in the bottom of my panniers. Started a mission to eat it all as its just extra weight I'm carrying. Reckon I should be getting near the bottom of it by the time I get to Broome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did a bolt from Halls Creek at 3:30am. Stratergy to avoid the heat - cycle when its cooler. It worked well. By 8am had done 110km and stopped for breakfast. Stopped again at lunch time and was going to call it a day, but sitting there resting the wind gusted up.. Arrrgghhh.. A tail wind. What could I do.. Jumped back on and did another 50km before calling it quits for the day. 190km all up. Since that was such a success, I repeated it today. The 100km into Fitzroy Crossing was done by 8am.  Cycling at night is definitely cooler. Bugger all traffic about and you don't get to see the hills. Well, actually between Halls Creek and Fitzroy Crossing there aren't any. It seemed pretty flat all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The temps are hitting the low 30's. But feels like its a bit less humidity. I'm looking longingly at Port Hedland - their max is about 25.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Derby</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/07/2011-07-14-derby/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-14T19:38:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-07-14T19:38:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-07-14:/posts/2011/07/2011-07-14-derby/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well after leaving Fitzroy Crossing I only made it 30km out of town before crashing in the shade of a tree.

It was hot, a head wind, and some  hills. Gentle hills, but with the heat and headwind, too  much to power over. So was the slow grind up and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I left, I had lunch with Anton. He's holidaying about and was admiring my bike. We chatted and he offered lunch, so we sat under the tree and ate some sandwiches. Thanks Anton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was still a bit of a head wind when I left in the morning, and sometimes it blew hot. Luckily it as cool most of the time. I'd planned a big day, but by lunch time, could only look for shade and rest. From that I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was an easy 90km into Derby.  Had plans to do so postal stuff, but ended up talking with Mac and Gerrie most of the day. They were going to ride the Gibbs River road, but changed their minds after a day of corrugations,dust and 4x4's. Lots of traffic on the road. There were going by bus to Kununurra to spend their holiday up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broome - Derby road had lots of traffic on it. Surprised me. It was still hot, so I didn't sleep well, Started cycling at 1am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cycling at night is cooler, but sometimes the wind is still hot. It cools more towards 3am.. I'd pass through rivers of warm or cool air as I'm riding alone. The stars are all spread out just for me. Currently the moon is rising, but is hidden by midnight. I can tell different areas by their smell or feel. Still lots of bugs at times. Annoying are the ones that crash into you and then hunt about for a spot to bite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just made Roebuck Roadhouse this morning at 4am. Faster than I'd planned. The plan was to spend the day here resting and then do two big days to get to Sandfire Roadhouse 300km away. But the weather has cooled. There will not be any 30C or over days. This is good. So will do some more daytime cycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Roebuck Roadhouse to Port Hedland</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/07/2011-07-14-roebuck-roadhouse-to/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-07-14T20:10:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-07-14T20:10:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-07-14:/posts/2011/07/2011-07-14-roebuck-roadhouse-to/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Huh.

&lt;p&gt;I Just before leaving I met Aitor and Evelin, cycling from Boome south. So we rode together for a bit. Wow. Evelin only started cycling from Darwin. Amazing. Picking to my mind the hardest place to start touring in. Aitor has been on the road two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was hot. So that night I left them and continued my night cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about over here, is that once the day warms up i doesn't cool in the afternoon. It needs the night to cool down. I miss that on the east coast - how its hot in the middle of the day, but cooler in the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So cycling at night, trying to find some shade and then rest or sleep in the heat.  Tiring it has been. Been some days just so tired, that I have slept for a couple of hours in the middle of the day. But a lot of sleepless times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On night a car with a trailer passed fast. Two hours later I found them in the bushes on the right hand side. They where okay - and getting the car back on the road and then the trailer out. I didn't stay about as they said I couldn't help. I wasn't going to argue with them..  An hour and a half later they passed fast again. I don't think they learn't their lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting in the shade in the day I see all the small creatures: so many differant ants, beetles, bees, wasps, spiders, lizards, birds. More wildlife than I thought would be about. Cause at night i see snakes and bugs. Not seeing to much of the  larger animals. Welll, there was a kangaroo that almost hit me. What is it about them - i'm not going that fast. It bound from the road edge just in front of me across the road. Road kill for sure if it does that with anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been lucky - it showered one night - not enough to dampen everything. Just enough to give the smell of rain and a hint of coolness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then past Sandfire Roadhouse it really showered and rained. Got wet. But was happy it was 15C and cool. Such a releif after all the hot days and nights. I was riding in the morning when it started. That night I slept well. First time in a while.  Slept from 5pm through to 7am. Then had breakfast, before cycling in the day for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breakfast was in the tent - lots of flies. The pesty ones that walk all over your face and dive onto the spoon from the pot to your mouth. Arrrghhh.. So annoying those flies. Eat in the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeGray River rest area was the first one I stopped at for a long time. Well not much reason to stop at them at night, and in the morning - just looking for a place to crash and avoid the sun later. One I stopped I stayed. Since I didn't want to stay in the rest area, I didn't stop.  Stopped for lunch, but ended up staying the night.  Met lots of nice people there. Got given a dish of home made pasta sauce, a packet of buscuits, and a feed of roast potatoes. All from different people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was Port Hedland, and then South Hedland.  Hmmm Port Hedland was not pleasant.  Busy road, narrow, winds. And there is nothing in Port Hedland.  Well,  not true - there is the port. Some services.  South Hedland has shops.  Its a very spread out place. People drive everywhere. The two places are about 20km apart. Lots of trucks, 4x4 and road trains.  Busy. It was also windy. So after going into Port Hedland, it was a head wind getting out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone said to me the port started at Port Hedland, but then the town run out of space because of the salt flats - so South Hedland was started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever, it was a bit dissapointing to hit the first town after leaving Derby and have to deal with Port Hedland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm staying in a van park in South Hedland tonight. All the sweating up north, everything is loaded with salt. So while the last two days have been cooler, everything is damp as the salt absorbs the moisture at night. Washed everything today and dried it. Feels so good to have clean dry gear. The last wash/dry cycle was in Halls Creek - a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plan now is to head down the coastal route towards Perth. Looking at the map today, there are road houses spaced out more - well not too far apart. Towns are a bit sparse, but water shouldn't be a problem.  Going to head that way, can always change my mind and swing back inland if I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't matter who you talk to about how busy the roads will be - someone will always say the other is more busy. There is definitely a lot more road trains about Port Hedland though, than I've seen getting here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not many pictures so far, as I forget to take them, and cycling at night, well, I think there is lots to see, but my phone camera won't work so well. I'm still leaving early in the mornings, but should have more day time cycling, so maybe some more pictures from now on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Whim Creek, Roebourne, Karratha, Nanutarra Roadhouse, Perth</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/08/2011-08-05-whim-creek-roebourne/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-08-05T20:03:00+10:00</published><updated>2011-08-05T20:03:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-08-05:/posts/2011/08/2011-08-05-whim-creek-roebourne/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/18072011278-730440.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay. A bit behind on the journal updates. Catching up now, all in one post on the trip down to Perth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently resting up in Perth, eating lots, replacing and repairing gear. The big items  that need work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bike - time for another Rohloff oil change. Drive chain side oil seal may be leaking oil. Not a problem as noted on the German Rohloff website, but I'd like to get it fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike - make a new chain case. The old one has worked well, but it could be better. Will have a bigger choice of plastic in Perth to make the improved version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike - seat and handlebar grips need patching or replacing from wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tent - time to get a new one, or patch the holes. Actually I've decided this already and am going to make my own. Should be able to drop the weight from 4kg to around 1.5kg for a two person, mossie net and bath tub setup.  I'll write more on this as I build it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panniers- my home made set has been getting lots of patches. They are more than ten years old now. Since I'm going to make a new tent, I'll make another set out of new material. I'll get to ride about Perth and test them before I leave to ensure they hold up.  If the new ones work, I'll make another set and replace all my panniers. Weight loss will be at least 2kg which with the tent will save about 5kg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm cutting the weight, I'll take the scales to my gear and see what else can go on a diet.  Should be able to save another kilo or two that way. Ideally I'll drop six or seven kilos from my gear list before I leave Perth. I'm  not expecting that to happen fast.  Wandering about the city today checking out the camping shops, found the Munda Biddi Foundation office.  Was so excited - bicycle track. Will definitely ride some of that. Sarah there was so helpful and friendly. Thanks heaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also looking at doing some short  walks - the Bibbulmun Track looks interesting. Its only 1000km&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But not until I get my bike gear sorted. The light tent will be good for that also. Anyway, more on that later..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update on getting to Perth:  Was glad to get out of Port Hedland area. I left about midnight from the caravan park. There was still a fair bit of traffic at that time. Road trains moving ore and gas, and general goods. But they dropped of by the time I was past the Newman turn off.  Was feeling like resting, so stopped riding before Whim Creek. Saved that for the next day. Nice little pub. Food and a game of pool. If you ever call past - say hi to Harry.  Roebourne plains was next. That was exciting. Large empty plains of short grass, with a strong head wind, but hid out in a creek bed that was so nice, I stayed two days. Would have stayed another day, but needed water.  Next was the food and water stop in Karratha. It was a quick stop, get supplies and leave. Reminded me of Port Hedland. Lots of cars and trucks, not many people walking or cycling. But it did have less road debris.  I was still night riding as the temps were up, and well, it was quieter. Got used to having the road to myself and the occasional road train. Night riding continued all the way to Nanutarra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I started feeling sick after leaving Karratha. I had passed the Fortescue roadhouse by about 40km, and instead of turning back, pushed on. It was a tough few days with short distances and lots of resting. Spent all of one day in one spot. It was a struggle to get to Nanutarra. With the next roadhouse 200km, and the next town 140km after that, I decided to get the bus to Perth to recover. Spent three more days waiting for a bus, and then 20hours travelling. Not sure what it was - bad water, bad food, a build up of fatigue from long rides without enough rest, some other bug. Nausea, tiredness and weak. Was feeling lots better after three days just waiting for the bus.  Met a German cycle rider at Nanutarra. He was on a two week holiday and rode from Broome and was heading south. We shared thoughts on the towns and both agreed on Port Hedland.  He was relying on the caravan crowd to get water. I wonder if this is just a overseas visitor idea or if Australian riders do it also. I'm happy with 23liters and a plan to get between known water spots, than needing to ask caravan people all the time.  Photos: There isn't much water about..  Kangaroos are strays?  Robe River did have water in it. Was a nice spot to hangout for a day. Stayed there, slept, washed, rested. This was after Karratha. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical Mass Perth is dead. I hunted about online but couldn't find any activity since 2009. In the end I turned up on the steps outside the Western Australian Library on the last Friday in September,  but didn't see any gathering.  After waiting about for half an hour I gave up. I reckon its dead.  Someone prove me wrong...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost another tooth. It had been sore for several months, but not agony sore, so I'd been ignoring it. Well, not just that, there aren't many dental services in country Australia. Finally after procrastinating a lot, I saw two dentists here.  Both said the same thing - root canal or extraction. Given that root canal costs upwards of $2000, extraction it was.  Another one gone.  Dental costs in Australia are incredibly high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been thinking of doing a long walk while I'm over here. Was looking at my gear and the weights of everything and decided to get a smaller cooking pot. Also tried out making a Penny Stove. The stove works well, but not sure if I want to use metho or not. I've gotten to like the MSR Whisperlight International - turn it on and cook for as long or as short as needed. Measuring out the metho and lighting up, sometimes I burn out before my meal is done, other times I burn way longer than I need. Metho produces less heat than Shellite or petrol. Hence means more fuel needed. Prices for a litre range from $5 upwards. (found some for $3 in Bunnings, but as Bunnings only exists in large cities, I'm not counting on this). Shellite, my prefered fuel, is about $7 a litre, and petrol is about $1.50ish.  But metho has its uses, I'll keep testing and then decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding about in the city on the weekend and found Perth Pride Fair day was on. Advertised as "fun for the whole family". They claimed over 40 stalls, but I'm doubtful about that.  It was in a small park, fenced off, with bag searches and a $15 entry fee. Needless to say I didn't go in. Talking with the locals, in past years it was free, then a gold coin donation.  I wasn't the only one that declined to enter. Some thought the entry fee was to ensure they didn't have another one next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been house sitting a friends apartment.  Not much space on the floor, but I've been using it to make a new shelter. Still haven't finished, but finding the building is going real easy - well apart from the constant shuffling about on the floor. To replace my existing tent, I'm going to change to using a 8'x10' (2.4m x 3m) tarp. Making the tarp from 48.4 g/m² Cuben fabric. No sewing involved. Using tape and glue. It will have no-see-um mossie net and bathtub as well. The mossie net will have two entrances, and no zippers. Zippers work well, until they break, then they are a head ache. Going to try having extra material and twisting it shut. Trying to keep everything simple and easy to repair on the road.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Perth: Bike path art, Oil leaks &amp; tents</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/10/2011-10-21-perth-bike-path-art-/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-10-21T12:37:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-10-21T12:37:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-10-21:/posts/2011/10/2011-10-21-perth-bike-path-art-/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/01102011317-777824.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rohloff hub is back getting looked at. The seal change didn't fix the problem. While the shop was looking at the issue, they found the frame dropouts were twisted. I now have straight dropouts, but the hub is still leaking. Also found that my headset bearings could have been better - got them changed to a new set that have o-ring seals to keep the water and dust out. Wow! That was an improvement. I hadn't noticed how bad the headset was. Motivated by these this improvement, I changed the front disk rotor. The previous rotor didn't want to stay straight. It was once, but guess it got banged and bent. It was never the same after that. Bending would work for a while making the wobble less, but sooner or later it would get worse again. Got tired of it and changed the whole rotor out. No more pulsing brakes! Now that was an improvement. I wonder why I waited so long to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last of the glue arrived so its back working on the new home. There's a picture of the space I have to work in. Bit squishy. I do the glue work in the morning, so that by evening I can move it and sleep in the same space. While more space would make it easier, I'll get there in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Perth: Smelling the flowers</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/11/2011-11-30-perth-smelling-the-f/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-11-30T11:31:00+11:00</published><updated>2011-11-30T11:31:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2011-11-30:/posts/2011/11/2011-11-30-perth-smelling-the-f/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2011/2011-11-30-image0.jpg" &gt;

I've also put off doing an update with other things happening. More on that at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting about Perth doing some preparation stuff, and a lot of procrastination. Perth was surprisingly relaxing for a city. So was easy to just go with the flow and drift into days of doing, well not much at all.  There was a lot of lazing about reading, cause I finally bought an ebook reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November I bought the
&lt;a href="http://www.sony.com.au/product/prs-t1"&gt;Sony WiFi Touch&lt;/a&gt;
ebook Reader. Oooh I like it. I got white, figuring that would absorb less heat in the sun when outdoors. The reading experience in daylight is really good. Never again will I be without a book to read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a wifi connection I could browse the internet and download and read free ebooks. What I could not do was buy a book that used Digital Restriction Management (DRM), download it to the reader and read it on a wifi connection. DRM books need a pc first. Maybe this will change if or when Sony opens their Australian ebook store. But that is not the end of the problems for DRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I got the Sony over the Kindle was that the Sony supports epub books - the open standard, that everyone except Kindle supports. You buy a Kindle and you can only buy your books from Amazon. Your locked in. Want to read that book on a non Amazon device - well you''ll have to buy the book again. Buy a Sony (or any non Amazon ereader), and you can buy books from a number of sellers and you can use those books on any other reader (except the Kindle).  You get the picture.  One thing the Kindle does hide, is DRM. You don't see it because you cannot read your book anywhere else except on the Kindle.  But its still there. DRM means the book you "buy" isn't yours. Your buying a licence to read the book, and that's it. At some point that licence can be taken away from you. This has
&lt;a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/168654/amazon_removes_ebooks_from_kindle_store_revokes_ownership.html"&gt;happened&lt;/a&gt;
on the Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried DRM books on the Sony to see how it worked, and then decided to do the sensible thing and NOT buy any more books that use DRM!!!  Sounds drastic, but isn't. Aside from how I feel about DRM itself, the using DRM experience is too annoying, and problematic for me. Adobe runs the DRM authorisation, so you need an account with them. You can download and use their software or use the Sony library software. I started with the Sony software that come with the reader, but also downloaded the Adobe software as well. What ever you do, you will need an account with Adobe. You probably will also have one with Sony, as you have to set that up to register the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking back on it now, you can probably do the whole thing with just the Sony software, and the Adobe account. I stopped using the Sony software early on, and started using the far superior
&lt;a href="http://calibre-ebook.com/"&gt;Calibre&lt;/a&gt;
software to organise my ebook library. The Sony software was to me, limited, and clumsy to use. Calibre has way more options for organising books, and a far better interface. Calibre doesn't support DRM as that is only available from Adobe, but it can be used to copy a DRM book onto the ebook reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was using the Abode software. You buy the book. You want to read the book. The file you get isn't the book, its a ticket to get the book. You load this into the Adobe software, and then you get the book. But you can't read the book, until you use it on "authorised hardware". You use the software to authorise the pc, then you can read DRM  books on the pc. To read the DRM books on the ereader you authorise the ereader. This is letting Adobe know that a certain PC and a certain ebook Reader are connected to your account; a list of what your allowed to read books on. Note: at this stage, that is two authorisations. You only have six authorisations in total for an account. As I travel, I have to remember to revoke authorisation of the PC if I authorise it, as there is no way to revoke an authorisation remotely. To revoke an authorisation, I had to google to find the keyboard combination, that brings up a hidden window to deauthorise the PC. The software from Adobe doesn't have it as a menu option. If you authorise a PC, and the hard disk dies - well, that is one authorisation you cannot revoke. You now have five left. Er, four, because you need one for the ereader. Buying the ereader, doesn't give you an authorisation. That can only come from Adobe. Same thing if the ereader breaks or is stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Sony reader has come out, it has had some updates available for it. One of the early bugs would hang the reader, needing it to be reset. You didn't lose your books, but the authorisation was lost. I'm not sure if that used up an authorisation or not. There is no way that I can find to get a list of how many devices you have authorised. I had to reauthorise the ereader again to be able to read the DRM book I had on it. On the road, without access to a PC, a reset would mean that I couldn't read that book. If the reset is using up authorisations, then I'm one down already. I only had the problem once, and fortunately that bug has been fixed, and I haven't had to do that again. But I still can't tell how many authorisations I have left.  Once all the authorisations are gone, so are your books. You might have the file, but the words are encrypted, so you cannot read them. Luckily I'm not attached to that book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;
for some of the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#Controversy"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt;
on DRM. It applies not just to books, but to music, videos, games, etc..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll stick to non DRM books. Fortunately there are a lot of them. Besides out of copyright books that are DRM free (and often free of charge), there is a growing number of authors and publishing houses that sell DRM free ebooks. Yes you still pay for these books, but your buying the book - its yours to keep and read forever and no one can take that right away from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently I have over 800 DRM free books loaded my my reader, and still I have not used up all its internal storage. I don't think I'll run out of books to read for a long time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough on ebooks. Support DRM free books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to other matters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd decided to stop loafing about Perth and start doing some cycling down south of Western Australia while I finished my tent. Plan was to leave stuff in Perth, only take the barest essentials and keep working on the tent as I go. More incentive to finish it when the mossies can get in..  There's now a special place in my heart for tent makers. It seemed so simple lying on my mat looking at it. How hard could it be? Not really hard, but long and time consuming,  and lots of compromises, that I hadn't thought about until I hit them. Trying to get the one perfect tent is not possible. Don't try it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a Saturday, and I was all set to cycle off on the Tuesday, when got a call from family. A family member had a fall, sustained a head injury, and was in hospital having surgery. Instead of cycling out out of Perth, I packed up everything and I flew to Cairns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head injuries are tricky things. Recovery will be long and slow, and maybe not back to the stage before the injury. For now, we all wait and hope that things go well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since arriving, I've been staying close and trying to help out as much as I can. Doesn't feel like much, but I'm sure that it counts. I'll not be here permanently though. Mean while, I'm back to working on the list of things I hadn't finished in Perth, and planning a route south for when I leave.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Cairns to Perth</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/03/2012-03-28-cairns-to-perth/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-03-28T11:04:00+11:00</published><updated>2012-03-28T11:04:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-03-28:/posts/2012/03/2012-03-28-cairns-to-perth/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/IMG_0135_2.jpg" &gt;

The weather forecast was for more rain down the whole east coast.  My planned route south kept changing based on what roads were flooded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't enjoying the heat and humidity at all. Browsing about online looking for a cooler place to be, found that Jetstar had $199 tickets to Perth. Perth was dry, and cool. Didn't take too much thinking before I had booked a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perth is sooo good. Cool and dry. Loving the weather here. Back waiting for gear to arrive. I'd taken all my stuff to Cairns, so, needed to bring it all back again. Used Australia Post to send most of it, as it was cheaper than the airline luggage rates. But Aus Post delivery is erratic. Over a week since posting, it hasn't arrived yet.  I'm hopeful that it will arrive this week.&lt;/p&gt;

Munda Biddi Trail
&lt;/a&gt;
.  The plan was to take a jaunt down south, then loop back into Perth for a final pack up before leaving Perth this year.  It didn't work out so well.&lt;/p&gt;

Munda Biddi Trail
&lt;/a&gt;
.  The plan was to take a jaunt down south, then loop back into Perth for a final pack up before leaving Perth this year.  It didn't work out so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mundi Biddi trail is really well marked.  However, there are a number of other trails in the area that cross or travel along with the Mundi Biddi. Some are: Heritage Trail, Bibbulmun Track, Kep Track, Kalamanda Track.  Some are cycle use only, others walker use only, some mixed use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They all use triangle shaped markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was really poor at watching for the markers, and even when I noticed a trail marker, I was slack at noticing the difference between the markers.  I'm sure that I rode or walked every track in the area at one time or another.  There was lots of back tracking.  With a loaded touring bike, this was slow going. There were many times when I didn't ride due to a reluctance to bounce my bike and panniers over the bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first section, I managed to clock up just over 75km to cover the 42km marked track between the sites.  I did improve, but still managed to get off trail a few times each day.  Still riding along in the bush is so blissful. Part of my problem with missing the markers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After arriving in Perth to fine cool weather, the first day back riding it warmed up and started showering. I was soon sweating like a cracked fish tank.  Any fitness from cycling into Perth has long since vanished. Pushing up and down trails was a full body workout. I slept well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was planning to return to Perth, I'd left gear behind. Unfortunately, I had left the stove repair kit behind. While the stove has been running for years without any problems, I do (normally) carry the repair kit for it, in case of problems when well away from the shops. One small rubber seal had hardened with age and was leaking fuel, making stove use risky.  While I'd ridden Sydney to Cairns without a stove, I wasn't looking forward to doing that again, so returned to Perth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to clean up my gear left in Perth and head out again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Aren't you afraid?</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/05/2012-05-15-arent-you-afraid/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-05-15T00:33:00+10:00</published><updated>2012-05-15T00:33:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-05-15:/posts/2012/05/2012-05-15-arent-you-afraid/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still in Perth, house sitting for another week.

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still in Perth, house sitting for another week. Time enough to finish this article that I'd been thinking about for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While travelling solo by bicycle, I’m often asked: “Aren’t you afraid?”  My answer is:”No”, but, if feeling social, followed with “Afraid of what?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I get the vague “something happening”, but more often it’s a definite “someone like ...” :Ivan Milat, Peter Falconio or The Kimberly Killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My arguments that they’re examples that didn't target bicycle riders and that psychotic killers live in cities seldom sway.  They’re just not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one such question, I resolved to track down just how much of a risk it is from the mad killer, so I could give a more accurate and informed counter response.  Maybe with hard numbers on my side it would make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking at the numbers, a fairer response might be “Why aren’t you afraid?”  While, not to deny that bad things can happen, and that a certain amount of personal responsibility is needed,  the odds are overwhelming in favour of a lifetime of happy, safe and uneventful (from foul play) bicycle touring trips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you're not familiar with the above examples offered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan Milat,  perhaps the most infamous, having drawn international attention for killing seven (five international tourists, two locals)  in the early 1990’s.  He targeted hitch-hiking backpackers. Stopped, offered lifts, and once he had them in his vehicle, proceeded to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Falconio, a British tourist, is an odd one to be afraid of. I presume the fear is that something similar will occur. Peter is listed as presumed dead, following foul play in 2001 after the car he was a passenger in stopped late one night on the Stuart highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kimberly Killer, only heard from elderly retirees, was a case I wasn’t initially familiar with. Back in 1986, Joseph Schwab, a German tourist, flew to Australia, and killed five people for reasons unknown, before being killed himself by police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of them were targeting bicycle tourists. Though, the Kimberly Killer most meets the criteria of random killing of strangers. Someone, who if you met at the time, it would not be your lucky day. But one case, 27 years ago, is a long time ago to still be worried about it occurring today. Not a very good  reason to hold back from going for a bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the cases above made the news because of their international links, doubtless there are other homicides each year that don’t make the popular press.  So to get an idea of how risky death by homicide is, we need to know who is being killed, how many people are killed each year, and  where are they killed.  Fortunately, all this information is freely available on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the Australian Institute of Criminology,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide/victim-offender.aspx" &gt;
Homicide Victim-offender relationship stats 2006-7 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;36% - Friends/acquaintances&lt;br&gt;
15% - Family&lt;br&gt;
13% - Other   (Includes work colleagues, employee/employer, former employee/employer, gang members, and former gang members)&lt;br&gt;
10% - Intimates&lt;br&gt;
25% - Strangers&lt;br&gt;
2% - Unknown&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re far more likely to be killed by someone you know than a total stranger. In 74% of homicides, the victim knew their killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's worse if you’re female. Take the guys out of the mix and people you know account for 94% of homicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Female victim and offender relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;53% - intimates &lt;br&gt;
21% - family&lt;br&gt;
16% - friends/acquaintances&lt;br&gt;
6% - strangers&lt;br&gt;
4% - other (Includes work colleagues, employee/employer, former employee/employer, gang members, and former gang members)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who said having a partner was good for safety?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to continue on to kids;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Child victim and offender relationship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;69% - custodial parent&lt;br&gt;
15% - non custodial parent&lt;br&gt;
8% - Acquaintance&lt;br&gt;
4% - close friend&lt;br&gt;
4% - other relationship&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranger doesn’t even make a significant category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you would expect, when family, friends and other people you know are trying to kill you. Where do they succeed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide/location.aspx" &gt;Location of Homicide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;61% - residential&lt;br&gt;
24% - street/footpath&lt;br&gt;
13% - other&lt;br&gt;
2% - unknown&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You feeling safe at home?  With family, partner, or friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping it in perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of Australian homicides in 2006-7 was: 298.   Of that, 60 homicides were by strangers: 60 homicides out of 21 million Australians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And contrary to what it might seem like from the media, the number of homicides has been in &lt;a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.aspx" &gt;decline since 1989&lt;/a&gt;, while the Australian population grew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider that the death rate from &lt;a href="http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.aspx"&gt;homicides in 2006-07 was 1.3 per 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/safety/publications/2009/pdf/rsr_04.pdf"&gt;
Road deaths in 2007-08 was 6.9 per 100,000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afraid to be on the road? You're much more likely to be a road fatality then a homicide victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more numbers and higher risk ratings, head over to the Australian Bureau of Statistics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3303.0"&gt;Causes of Death in Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And have a browse.   In 2010, the leading cause of death was Ischaemic heart disease: 21,708  followed by Cerebrovascular diseases: 11,204.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Interesting:  Prostate cancer 3235,  Breast cancer 2864.  Prostates are getting the bottom end of publicity compared to breasts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the top killers, the risk can be reduced by healthy eating and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not afraid. Rather than being afraid of a low risk event (homicide),  pay attention to what has a higher risk status (health) and can be influenced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fairwell to Perth and heading out into the great outdoors. It has been good being in Perth, though it feels like the place that you visit and end up staying years and years. Its been almost a year since I arrived.  The Mundi Biddi is on again. The first day was an easy ride. The second a bit more of an effort. Still with plenty of time to look about and admire the scenery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other times its been more of a challenge, with lots of time to puff and pant up and down the hills. Time to get the legs back into shape.  Seems the only part of me that was getting any exercise in Perth was my waistline. I'm sure that will change soon though. In the mean time, the trail is calling..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it's not true about just your waist getting a workout here - there was the cookie lifting too! Porridge stirring... ear plug searching for the noisy moments...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balanced fitness program!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the modern cons. The local area is now big on mining, but it orginally was logging. There is still logging today though. I stopped and saw King Jarrah. Looked a lot like this tree:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But standing upright. It also had green leaves, the bark was alive.. Okay, not a lot like that one. The one above is called "Whim". I didn't find out why. It was 600years old when they cut it down and mounted it in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

Number of reasons. It was increasingly like a tunnel under the trees. It was cold and damp. And probably the most important one: I was tired of following those little markers. While there were less trails to get lost on as the Munda Biddi progressed, there where many times when I was lost, and had to back track. Other times wondering if I was on the right trail, as it had been a while since I'd seen the. marker.  The mining and logging diversions also was annoying. There was another near the hut that I would encounter if I continued.  So, after looking a the map, I returned to Dwellingup and headed west.  I immediately felt much better about the trip. Also got away from the set routine of making the next camp site.  This is my time to pick a point. The info for the Munda Biddi says the purpose built campsites are an easy day apart. They are not. There are other campsites you must use, that don't have the hut and water tanks.  All up the ride was good. I was told that further south it opens up a lot more and isn't so hilly. Maybe next time I'm back over this way I'll try again. I do think that the time I was riding it isn't the best. It was dark, cold and damp a lot of the time. Anyway, I'm off it and heading east. And a town i just had to visit was Wandering. Not that there was a lot there. Even the post office was getting renovations so wasn't open. The caravan park was shut for the long weekend. But still, it was a good ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A caravan park SHUT for a long weekend?  How weird.  Good that you've found your own path again.  Happy wandering.&lt;/p&gt;

Missed that spending all the time down in the gullies. But up top now, sheep, cattle, wheat, oats and canoloa fields, lots of space for the wind to get up some speed. Its not holding back. There is a real roar to the wind in the trees. Cause, that isn't helping my forward speed at all. No matter how many bends I go around, it almost always seems to be a headwind. A few side winds for variation, but never(?) the dreamed about tailwind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah the wind. With a poor choice on the camp site, the flapity flap, flapity flap of the tent added some music to the night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Showers and rain joining the wind, and they are going to be keeping company for the next few days. The farmers will certainly looking forward to the rain. Not sure that I am... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a surprise. After updating email in Narrogin, Jen messaged saying she was coming for a visit. I thought it was a long way to drive myself, but sat about chatting with the guys in the information center until she arrived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen is not a camper. I tented, she slept in the car. (Actually, didn't sleep). Then the plan on what to do was bandied about.. Jen was very persuasive. She brought cookies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/cookie-785310.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/cookie-785310.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did a bit of a road trip. Stopped in Pingelly for some food. Looked at some of the old time buildings that haven't been painted in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/IMG_0443-786620.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/IMG_0443-786620.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then stopped in Perth for a day or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly the south is increasingly cold, wet and windy at the moment. North should be warmer, dryer, maybe not as windy? Actually, its going to be just as wet and windy for the next week up there as well. But it won't be so cold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey little girl - would you like some cookies?  (stranger danger stranger danger!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next thing Megan wakes up back in Perth as if none of this travel stuff had ever happened! (Well besides the soaking wet tent tarps)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camping is seriously overrated, I thought to myself while bouncing around on one foot in the middle of the night (in the rain), trying to not pee in my shoe while discovering "behind the tree" is
&lt;strong&gt; always &lt;/strong&gt;
an euphemism for "bull ant's nest"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm on the other side of the world in Leicester, where they had their "SUMMER" riverside festival today - freezing cold at only about 10 degrees, though the rain has stopped for a change.  I'm glad I'm not camping.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of going up the coast, I started inland a bit. Still it was windy. When windy, trees are not your friends. The best place is sheltered behind a dense bunch of shrubs. My first night I thought I'd found the best spot. But someone else beat me to it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-IMG_0450-709747.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-IMG_0450-709747.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn't move them, so hunted about and found another spot, not as good. It wasn't as bad a night as I was expecting. Toodyay was the first town I stopped in. It looks the place that gets lots of visitors on the weekend. Monday morning, it was very quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p4-IMG_0451-711490.jpg" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next few days were uneventful. Pedallying, and hiding from the wind at night. Though, it wasn't that windy.  Then I let my guard down. That night it was windy. I'd stopped not quite on a hill top, but sheltered behind some bushes. I checked later. Winds were over 60km/hr that night. And the thunderstorm. I was bounced about in my tent like a pea in a drum. Lightning was striking within a few km of my spot. I was trying to decide how much insulation my sleeping mat would provide if there was a strike nearby. I decided not enough!  That was a sleepless night.  Working on that it couldn't happen again, I stayed in the same spot the next night. All batterned down ready and it was dead still. The farmer nearby was out. All night had the drone of machinery as he worked the fields. Big empty fields out here. Wheat, barley, oats...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p6-IMG_0452-712735.jpg" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passed through the town of Bindi Bindi. There isn't much there. Not a shop, petrol station, or park. A few houses and a war memorial. Was some art work on the way though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p8-IMG_0453-713730.jpg" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miling was a nicer place. Chatted with the owner of the shop, while having a large serve of hot chips. Favourite would have to be Watheroo. Woke up to clouds and fog, but then the day turned into sun and blue sky for the first time in ages. Rolling into town and they had a park with benches and tables. Water tapes even. Sat down, dried off the tent, cooked breakfast, read for a while and soaked up the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

I did start to wonder if anyone was still living in them. Not a sole to be seen. I'd roll in, find some water and roll out.  Had my first over 100km day in a while. Wanted to stop at the 80km mark, but no where to camp. Low lying land, with out any bushes. With the recent rain, it was also damp. When I did find a spot, it was near the road, with old tin cans scattered about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-1-751162.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-1-751162.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From days when tinnies where really tin. Not sure if the aluminium cans will rust away. Mingenew was the first populated town. It has the distiction of having the largest grower supplied grain store in the southern hemisphere.  Last year over a million tons was harvested. So much that some had to be discarded, there wasn't any storage left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p4-3-752889.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p4-3-752889.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its also in the area for wild flowers, but I'm about a month too early for that. With all the grain, you'd think it would go by rail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p6-4-754071.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p6-4-754071.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The building looks too small and dated. And the rail like is too. Trucks rule the transport here, following the unused rail line into Dongara. Todays ride, Dongara and back. A nice 80km mail run. I didn't warm to Dongara at all. Was happy to get the mail, but, it was too busy. The Brand Highway passes through it. Lots of road train traffic, then all the caravans and camper vans. I had my tent out drying in the park. Council worker come to tell me I couldn't camp there. All the taps have no handles. And the servo's charge for air. The only thing anyone could tell me to see was the marina.  In the end, to touristy for me. I headed back out to Mingenew. Its been fine the last few days. Going to miss it. Rain is forcast again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Mullewa, and its so cold!</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/06/2012-06-27-mullewa-and-its-so-c/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-06-27T11:40:00+10:00</published><updated>2012-06-27T11:40:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-06-27:/posts/2012/06/2012-06-27-mullewa-and-its-so-c/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p2-p-730594.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was kinder on the way to Yalgoo, but while I was in town, the smell came on the wind; petrichor. The scent of rain.  It started raining a few minutes later.  Temps have been about the 10C mark. Without the wind, its pleasant. With the wind it's shivering time. I was told in Mullewa that I was on the road at the right time. Several of the mines have shutdown for upgrading. So the number of trucks on the road is way down. One guy said that they averaged 1500 a day. This seemed a lot, but then today in Mt Magnet, a local was saying he counted 70 in an hour. At 130 tons each, its a lot of stuff moving about. Anyway, there are less trucks right now. So, the road crew is doing what road crews do: patching the roads.  We passed each other lots. Road work is happening from Geralton to Mt Magnet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mt Magnet, didn't stop in town long. Feeling restless and liking being out camping. In town feels busy. I stopped at the shop, and spent a lot of time talking with people. The daily paper delivery to the shop was running late, so everyone was hanging around waiting.  Lots of mining workers about in town and on the roads. Most look young. They don't wave when we meet on the road. I wave, and they stare back with bovine indifference. The locals, and most truckies wave. Sometimes I get a blast on the horn. Some trucks horns are way underpowered for the size of the truck. While the last few days has been warmer, the forecast for the next few includes lows of 0C and frosts.  Going to be nippy. Today, after lunch, it was a sweltering 20C.  The weather, what can you do..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also amazing that at the same spot, George Ellis used to have 20acres of fruit trees and garderns, supplying fruit and veg to passing travellers. Where did it all go? Could do with some fruit and vege about the area.. Sandstone is a lovely little town. Had a wonderful tourist information center there also. I bought two dead tree books. One by a guy that tramped about the goldfields. He puts me to shame. He walked more in a day, than I'm cycling some days..  The other book on Bicycles in the Bush. Its really good.. All about bicycle use in rural Australia. Lots of fantastic info in to. The weather has been cold.. Ice on the tent each morning, so I don't get out of bed util the sun is up. Lots of reading time:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headed into Leinster from Sandstone. Its a mining town. Got a great all you can eat buffet each evening. I certainly gave it a work out. Lots of salads and fruit. Yum yum.. Also a day to do washing. Last wash was in Mingenew and it rained. The hot shower certainly felt good. The plan from here was to east, but i've a tooth that is causing me some discomfort. Since Dentists will be few and far between heading east. Okay, there will be none until Allice Springs. So I'm going to head to Kalgoorlie and find one there first and then decide what do to. So a fast pedal south.. Into the cold.. Hopefully it will not be a headwind all the way..&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Leonora, Kalgoorlie</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/07/2012-07-06-leonora-kalgoorlie/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-06T19:55:00+10:00</published><updated>2012-07-06T19:55:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-07-06:/posts/2012/07/2012-07-06-leonora-kalgoorlie/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Second day out of Leinster was one of those magical days.

The day topped out at 18C, but even better,  there was a tailwind! The first in weeks. I flew along. 75km in three hours. A quick food stop in Lenora and back on the road again. Had to use that tail wind while it was happening.  Then, at 90km a ute had stopped on the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Want a lift to Kalgoorlie?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You bet!".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couple hours of interesting conversation later, I'm loading my bike up 25km from Kal, when the farmer that owned the land on both sides of the road drove up. Not only did he give me his dentists number,  he also let me camp on his land overnight. Bonus!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kalgoorlie-Boulder has a lot of dentists. But there is large waiting lists for all of them. That dentist didn't have any appointments in the next two weeks, but next morning when I arrived in Kal, I found Smile Dental Clinic that did.  And even better,  they had one that day. Case of being there at the right time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to find somewhere close to stay for the night and Di at
&lt;a href="http://www.weslanaccommodation.com.au/"&gt;Weslan Accommodation&lt;/a&gt;
was very very helpful. If your ever in Kalgoorlie-Boulder and need accommodation, check with Weslan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dentists, there were two who looked at my gob and x-rays, couldn't find any obvious problem. In the end they ground a filling down a bit as they thought it was a bit high, and suggested trying a nasal decongestant in case it was a sinus infection.  The nerves for the teeth are close to the sinus, so infection in the sinus cavity can show up as tooth pain. Was my nose running? Of course, its been so cold and dry my nose runs constantly! They did find other work that could be done, (Doesn't that always happen?) but with no new appointments for three weeks, I've decided  not to stay. Will book an appointment with a dentist when I'm on the east coast again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, tomorrow I ride back up to Leonora.  I sure will not see a tail wind for that trip. It'll be a case of making friends with the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bit worried still, but loaded up with nasal decongestants, asprin, panadol, cloves, and other pain killers. Will just ride. If it blows up, I'll sort something out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder if needle nose pliers are the best sort to have...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leonora didn't feel that alive today either. Streets empty. Few people stopping at the servo for fuel.  I've hit the school holidays. 4x4, with families, some towing caravans all heading north. Got mugged for the faq questions a few times, before they all piled back into their cars and drove off. Met one couple with their small child, they'd driven from Perth for the weekend. Out to look at some sculptures past Menzies. 1600km round trip for the weekend. Needed to be back in Perth Sunday afternoon. Thats a lot of driving for the weekend. But then I look at the mining work out here.  Wether its driving the workers out to the mines from Kal, or trucking the ore hundreds and hundreds of kilometers for processing or shipping. There isn't any reason to stay in the small towns. Not when you can live in the city and drive out. The small towns just slowly die as more and more services leave.    Had some fun the other afternoon. I got to play tag with the showers. I'd pedal as fast as I could, helped along by gusts of wind just ahead of the rain. I'd just stayed ahead. A quick stop for a drink and bit of a rest, and the showers would catch me up again. I'd pedal and get away before they could wet me. This went on for 30km. Eventually I was out flanked. A cloud from the side got me.  Next morning managed to play the same game with the sun bursts through the clouds. Well, till the sun went to do something else.. Sometime in the last couple of days the cycling with all my touring gear has gotten easy again. Since leaving Perth it had been hard work. I guess my fitness is back up now. The area still surprises me. I was expecting cold nights and warm days. Getting the cold nights, and then cold days. The days with the showers were trying. 10C, a strong wind, and then showers.  But it will clear up in a few days. Then I'll probably not see any rain for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Laverton</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/07/2012-07-11-laverton/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-07-11T18:45:00+10:00</published><updated>2012-07-11T18:45:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-07-11:/posts/2012/07/2012-07-11-laverton/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Been a wet, cold day.

I wasn't expecting to make Laverton today, but had a tailwind, and I had to keep pedalling to stay warm.  Passed a few mine sites today, and a refinery. Was interesting to see small wind mills on top of the poles, with solar panels underneath. Guess it gets windy out here.  Started seeing the car wrecks on the side of the road. The number is only going to go up from here.  Staying in the caravan park tonight. Luckily it has a camp kitchen: a dry, warm, and out of the wind place to hang out in.  Applied for the permits for the Great Central Road at the visitors centre, and got them. Leaving in the morning. Will be no mobile reception until Warburton, about 550km away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Megan, it was an honor to meet you in the Laverton caravan park. We fossickers are in awe at your pluck! For solo travel I carry/wear a little satellite tracker you can see at FindMeSpot.com In MY case it kinda tells the kids on a daily basis "Sorry no inheritance yet" but it does allow the crowd back home to see whether I'm still moving or not and where I've got too. You could also check out Delorme's InReach which is better that FindMeSpot because with that you can craft a message in the field, such as "I need and inner tube" whereas Spot only facilitates the triggering of messages saved and stored (preloaded) before the actual need arises, Spot messages can only be altered while you have internet access.

&lt;p&gt;I just thought that I should add an explanation to any other watchers of Megan's blog about internet access between Laverton and Alice Springs. Where Megan has gone there will be NO phone or internet coverage for most of her next segment. One of our fossicking  club members, on his way into Laverton, stopped to chat with her many Kilometres from Laverton and she was travelling well. So for the next little while no news is not bad news.  That is what Megan was referring to when she wrote "no mobile reception until Warburton" She was taking 24 litres of water with her.(erniethecabbie@hotmail.com)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Makes the air so sweet.  No bees though. Think of the honey it would make... The first few days I had lots of people stop me and ask the questions. Was given some oranges a couple of times. One wonderful couple feed me well, and gave me oranges, apples, bananas, and some nut bars. Their bread, butter and honey sandwich, I almost pinched myself to see if I was dreaming. I was so yummy. I didn't, because I figured that if it was a dream, I didn't want to know. Was such a nice sandwich. The honey was from their local area, and I'd rate it as the best. The last couple days no one has stopped. The most I've had is people slowing down a bit and indicating if I'm okay.  Otherwise, days slipped by, just peddling away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grader crew where on the move. I found their work though.  First roadhouse: Tjukayiria. Was a welcome site. Had to try their Tjukayiria burger. Was so good, had another one. Was told that I was the first person to eat two in one go. I was hungry. I managed to fit another one in in the morning before leaving.  Martha, working there, kindly showed me about the local area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the animals in the zoo. Can you see the elephant there? On wild life, I have seen some camels, an emu, and one dingo and one wallaby.  Someone would ask how the road is. Well, its a dirt road. Its got character. Some bits have a hard surface, others are really soft. But the secret is to ride on the hard bits. Sometimes I've had to walk for considerable distance looking for a hard bit. I was planning to average 80km per day, but with the cold mornings and short days, am finding that even that is a struggle at times. Fortunately with all the cold, water isn't a problem. I'm carrying 24liters, leaving the road houses, and its well enough to get the distance done. Could even stay on the road a day or two extra.

A learning experience for all parties. The thought is to offer it as an on going tourist experience. Anyway, I jumped at the chance. Seemed a good way to get some local knowledge, and learn a bit more about the land I've been travelling through.  I almost was the only "tourist", but Mena, a worker new to the area came along also.  Learned lots for the morning. We had a goanna hunt. Learn't that they live deep down their hole in the ground. Its not really a hole, more a multi level underground sky scraper. Dug down a bit over a meter following the tunnel about as it curled down. Learnt that just because there is a goanna hole, and it goes down a long way, doesn't always mean the goanna is home. Score one for goanna, zero for hunters.  But the fire was going, coals nice and hot, so lamb chops and spuds in aluminium foil went in instead. On another bed of hot coals sans the foil was a damper baking.  The damper was self raising flour mixed into a dough with water. The fire burned down to coals and the coals raked away. Some flour was sprinked on the ground, and it started browning. The damper dropped onto this. About the shape of a turkish bread, and about an inch thick. Coals were then raked over the top. Some time later, coals raked off and the loaf turned, and coals added to the top again. When it was deemed ready, the coals were raked off, and the loaf hit with a stick to shake all the coals off. Serve with butter and honey.  Sorry, no photos provided as cameras were not allowed. But sitting around on the ground we learned a bit about the area and the people.  An interesting morning. Glad I had the chance to go along. Thanks to the people from Warburton and Ngaanyatjarra Council for providing the opportunity.  Tomorrow, the agenda is up early and start pedalling. It will be another long gap to the next update when internet is available again. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Uluru, Ayers Rock</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-03-uluru-ayers-rock/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-03T13:13:00+10:00</published><updated>2012-08-03T13:13:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-08-03:/posts/2012/08/2012-08-03-uluru-ayers-rock/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, after that last post, you probably thought I had a feed of hot damper.

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I left next morning, I thought about how simple it looked making damper. Then I met Mike. I'd heard about a cyclist heading my way, but reports were sparodic. I hadn't heard anything in days, so thought he might not actually be on the Great Central Road. Then I met Ted. Wonderful gentleman stopped and we chatted. The cyclist was about two hours back, so at say even 80km/hr, that was a long way back. But then he said later, between here and Warakunna Roadhouse. Oh.. I was 90km from there, so we could meet today. In the end I stopped and made lots of effort to mark the road. It he missed the markings I'd have to backtrack and find him.  We met. Mike rode 88km and was going to stop at 90. So it was a lucky chance that we met that night. Ted also left me a block of chocolate. Mike got some of it from me. Ted was so nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p4-Mike-749893.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p4-Mike-749893.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Mike and I sat and talked and talked. It was good to met another tourer. Been a long time since my last one. Was a real boost for me, and was also great to give Mike tips that I'd found out the hard way. Go read about Mikes trip at
&lt;a href="http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/tnbt"&gt;Crazyguyonabike.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike also lit a fire.  So next road house, I bought flour.  Got buggered up with the timezones for the weather balloon launch at Giles weather station. Hammered it to get there before 8:30, only to find I was too late. The launch was Central Time, I was on WA time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost missed the shop also, it posted a sign saying it was shutting for a while just as I arrived. A funeral was taking place at the local community.  I'd heard another report of two cyclists heading my way. So, set out to find them. As it happened we camped 5km apart and met first thing in the morning. Thomas and Stuart. I'd figured they would light a fire a night, and I'd have an experiment with making damper. Blow me down, I'd meet the traveling bakers. I'd no sooner explained about damper, that it seemed in minutes they'd produced scones, damper, and a cake! All baked on a fire, or a small stove with a couple of pots. Wow. I was so impressed. Speechless in fact.  A huge thanks to Stuart and Thomas for sharing some of their skill with baking with me. We also stayed the whole day talking. And next morning I baked my first damper. Thomas has a photo. I was to excited holding my damper to get my camera out.. It was (and still is) so exciting. Been baking a damper or two each day that I can since then. Lots to learn about fire temps, getting the coals right, length of bake time, etc. But so easy to get an edible damper. And so tasty doing the eating!  I'm still in the space of raving unbidden to people about cooking dampers. I'm sure it will pass in time... But it is really simple, fun and exciting. Try it :) Thomas and Stuart had a bag of fruit a lovely couple had given them for me. I'd met them the day before and been given a banana, chips and a couple of biscuits. All food that was happily accepted and eaten, but later they thought they'd should have left more fruit. Some people are so nice.  After farewell to Thomas and Stuart, onwards to Docker River.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p8-Truck-752894.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wasn't too many trucks on the road, but when they did, it wasn't too hard to decide where to be. Upwind!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p10-Hills-754245.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p10-Hills-754245.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road changed. Hills happened in the distance. Something to feast the eyes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p12-Snake-755770.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p12-Snake-755770.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early snake or legless lizard. Whatever, I decided to act and chased him or her off the road before the next vehicle arrived.  Sadly, I arrived in Docker River 5minutes after the shop had shut on a Saturday. I'd forgotten the day. So, another day and a half of resting, till the shop reopened on Monday at 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p14-Stove-757425.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p14-Stove-757425.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Couldn't say there where no facilities on the side of the road. If I hadn't already cooked damper the night before... Another morning, I met up with Henry and Jane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2012/p16-chair-759091.jpg" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weren't too many motorcycles on the road, and even less with a sidecar. Talked for about an hour. They have some similiar experiences with people stopped, asking a few questions and then leaving.  Also met William. Cycling on a single speed with full touring gear from Newcastle westwards. We didn't chat long. He was in a bit of a hurry. Speed for him on the sand was slow. We met early in the morning - I was still packing up the tent. He'd managed 36km the day before - so lots of walking.  The day for me ended up being 63km, proving what I'd found earlier in my travels - its slow touring on a single speed. Then yesterday the dirt road ended. Tar is back, and with it lots more traffic.  Tourists out in force. Until the next dirt road...&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Great Central Road Summary</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-03-great-central-road-s/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-03T14:44:00+10:00</published><updated>2012-08-03T14:44:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-08-03:/posts/2012/08/2012-08-03-great-central-road-s/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Overall, how did I find it.

I'd rate it as the best road I rode in Western Australia. I enjoyed the dirt riding. The level of traffic wasn't excessive for me. There were days when only a few vehicles passed, other days, a short stop while the convoy passed and it was good to go again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carried 24liters water out of each road house, so had ample water for the weather to make it to the next water stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was initially planning 80km days, the cold nights meant a late start to the day - the sun needed to be well up and have warmed to between 5 and 10C before riding. When sunset in WA was at 5pm, I'd stop at 2:30 ish to have a relaxed camp setup. Overall this meant shorter riding days but 60km was achiveable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't find the road terribly bad. There were certainly sandy spots that I walked. The road in NT was more sandy than in WA. There were times of dragging the bike through the sand. Been on better, had worse also.  Corrogations - yep, plenty. Weave about the flat spots, or worse case, ride slowly over each one. Riding was still faster than walking..  Sometimes the sides and the banks were in good shape, but other times they were churned up also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented with going off road a couple of times, but when the road was sand, off road was also sandy, so it was no gain. Worse in fact.  Seemed to be more upgrades happening in WA, but it may also depend on the time of the year of the ride - it upgrades have just happened for the tourist season, and before its had time to break up again.  Slowest average for travel in WA was 12km/hr. In NT it dropped to 9km/hr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other traffic - is the full list of considerate to "did they see me?". Lots of wonderful people stopped and handing out fruit or other food treats. Always very much appreciated. How can you thank those people enough?  I had enough food options at the road houses that I didn't feel constrained. Basics were available everywhere. Prices are higher, but your a long way from anywhere, and it costs a lot to get food in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traffic on the Great Central can only go up. Talking with carvaners, many said the numbers have risen in recent years as more baby boomers retire, load up the 4x4 and set off to "do" the desert tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camels - my count was less than a dozen, till one herd of eight upped the numbers. Not sure why this was. I saw dust in the distance a few times. Maybe they have been culled lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car wrecks also was down. I did spot some collecting areas where perhaps the road crew had gathered up the wrecks. One thing on the wrecks, the cost of a tow from the Great Central Road would be pricy. I spoke to a guy who broke his axle, $4000 was the quote for a truck to Alice Springs. Kalgoolie would be the nearest point in the other direction. Insurance options off road were also pricey, or not an option. So dumping the car could be a sane financial decision, expecially if the car is old, like most of the wrecks were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One funny incident. I rode up to two guys whose 4x4 had just rolled to a stop. I called out "I can give you a tow, but I don't have a rope". One called back "push push".. They were getting stuff out of the car, and I stopped. "a push" the other guy said. I was worried this point, did they think I was serious? Turned out they had a flat tire, and yeah, the battery was flat, so the more help push starting on the sandy road was certainly welcome. I got a laugh from it.. And yeah, push starting a 4x4 on sand is a hard push! &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>The Rock</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-15-the-rock/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-08-15T11:38:00+10:00</published><updated>2012-08-15T11:38:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-08-15:/posts/2012/08/2012-08-15-the-rock/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Well, some people noticed the lack of photos of the Olgas, and the Rock.

&lt;p&gt;There. Done.  I did hang about for a bit. And then headed out the highway. It was to have been another dirt road, but some people thought i really needed a permit to be there. I didn't think so, but after thinking about it a bit, decided that I wasn't welded to riding that particular dirt road, so turned back and rode on the highway. This was a mountain on the way that I would have passed closer to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing about the highway, lots of good stuff to pick up. Useful stuff. My bike is loaded up even more than before now. Found a foam bed roll, rolls of duct tape, spoons, forks, knifes, towels, plates, pots, pans, money,  and a useful half a meter of underground high voltage cable. It weighs a fair bit, actually, but I have plans for the copper in it. So the highway is pretty good at the moment. And to make it more exciting, I've had a tail wind. Yah.. Managed just over 100km today with that. Made a change from the 60km days into a head wind.  Been stopping early to get some baking in before it gets dark. Bought wholemeal flour in Yulara, and been having some type of bread for snacks each day. The last few days been experimenting with thinner bread, cooked on top of the stove on a plate. I like the baked bread, but haven't tried it on the stove yet, and lighting a fire and getting the coals right each day takes a lot of time. The wind doesn't always play its part - sometimes it doesn't die down till late.  Sooner or later fire bans will start, so stove use is a must. The thin breads seem to cook faster, well, they seem cooked for me..  Was looking forward to the border crossing today. Was thinking the bins at the checkpoint would be a good source of fruit and veges. But..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quiet and peaceful. Not that much traffic. No one stops to talk, like on the dirt roads. Just watching the landscape change. Spotted this old coral in a bunch of bushes..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close to Coober Pedy, the landscape changes. Barren is the word that springs to mind. There are also signs up warning about tresspassing and the danger of falling down mine shafts.  I'm finding that I'm not like the bare landscape. I want some trees, or at least bushes. Coober Pedy is not like I imagined it would be. I'm not sure what I was expecting really. Its a major tourist center by the feel of it. I'll not be staying long.

The first 100km was very barren. Nothing higher than ankle high. Would have been slow going in a headwind. Was so happy to see the bushs and trees start again. Almost got off and hugged them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually I did hug a tree when I stopped for the day.. Yep, I'm a confirmed tree hugger.  Met another bicycle rider on the road. Kerry on his holiday, cycling up the Highway to Darwin. He was in a hurry, so didn't stop long. I wished him always a tailwind. While he had it that day, the next was a different story.. Lots of caravans on the road. A few wide loads heading north. Wonder if this is for Coober Pedy...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was a tail wind! I averaged just over 30km/hr. Rode 170km before calling it quits. It looked like rain. Lucky I stopped then. I just got the tent up in a dip in some sand dunes when it did start showering. Even better, as I found this morning, 4km up the road, the landscape returned to barren. Nothing higher than ankle hight again. Would have been a bad place to stop and put up the tent. A crook night was had. Something upset my stomach. It played bongo drums all night, and periodically wanted out.  That really affected the sleeping. Energy levels this morning were not high.. Fortunately the tail wind continued until i was 6km from Woomera when it strengthened and moved. Slowest ride into a wind I'd ever had - just above walking speed. From the side was getting blown about the road. Luckily no trafffic. So taking shelter today. The weather station observations has it down as 50km winds at the moment. Even standing outside is unpleasant.  Lucky for me, I'm standing in a camp kitchen, clean, warm and dry. Will have to rest here another day til the winds die down a bit before moving it.

&lt;p&gt;Still feeling really excited about bread. Especially flat breads. Something about mixing the dough up, that is so simple, yet has lots of room for variation. Also like the hands on moving the bread about the plate and flipping over to cook the other side. Haven't geeked out the process at all. Still not using any measures, just eyeballing the amounts in the mixing pot, and judging the cooking time on the amount of heat off the stove.  This kitchen stove was not as hot as my MSR. Sometimes I get it wrong, but learning...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Megan, I am really enjoying your cycling about adventures, now to become cycling/vanning about? Ha ha. In a way that is what I would like to do too as in I've been challenging my self to unplug and just leave (Melbourne)..... So your blog was found at a perfect time and it is very inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so is this bread making adventure. So much so that I would love a recipe/hints on how to start getting into a rough ballpark with it. The photo above looks very tasty indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care for now&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi again Megan, just another thought came up regarding your bread... what are you cooking it on? I have a little gas stove and it is excellent but have come across this stove http://www.solostove.com/  recently and it makes a lot of sense in as much I would have endless fuel with no cost and importantly no gas cartridges to waste/recycle (which is difficult on the road). I'd love to know your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best wishes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Miro, I cooked on a MSR Whisperlite International stove. On the last photo, there is that aluminium plate under the bread - that is what I use on top of the MSR. The aluminium plate is nothing special - its actually the cover plate of a solar hot water system. It looked useful, so I carried it for 18 months, before I started using it as the cooking plate for flat bread :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the solostove: I used MSR Whisperlite Internation as I run it on Shellite, but could run it on Petrol if needed. Fuel for the MSR is always available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Solostove, depending where you travel, you may not find twigs, only grass, or nothing at all that burns. How does it go when its raining and all the twigs are wet? If your thinking of stealth camping, the smoke and smell of burning wood might be a give away. It may not be legal on total fire ban days either. Think of how you'd use it on all occasions, and how you'd carry after its out, and if it works for you...&lt;/p&gt;

Lots of opinions in Woomera about the recent mothballing of expansion plans at Roxby Downs. Didn't stop long in Port Augusta. While the traffic from Woomera down had been heavier, arriving in Augusta was overload. The usual bike lanes that vanish just when you need them. Diversions for cycle riders that direct you, and then fail to direct you anywhere else, leaving you wondering just where you are. I didn't need to do much of a shop, as i still had a lot of food from a big buy up in Coober Pedy. I got overly excited about the huge amount of choice in the IGA there and bought way way too much food. The stop in Woomera only put a slight dent in it. So I stopped at Stoney Creek Bush Camp Caravan Park, Wilmington to try a bit harder. Well, not just that, it is back cold and damp again. Crickey it's cold!!  The caravan park is well off the main roads, very quiet and I was allowed to put my tent up in one of the camp kitchen areas, so was out of the wind and showers. So nice and peaceful. Also, I must admit, I've been having a bit of a crisis of decision for the last few weeks. This has reared its self now about which way to go. I'm not sure about wanting to stay bicycling and tenting about the country. Some of it is definitely related to the long distances between towns out this way, and all the difficulties that causes, and of course the cold, wet weather. Of course there are many other reasons and its not a simple decision. There are a lot of things I like about cycling and tenting. But there is stuff that I'm starting to miss. I'll expand more on this another time. For now, I'm heading back to Sydney. I'm leaning towards getting a van, but still not sure if that's a good decision. Its still 1500km to Sydney, so lots of time to contemplate that option. For now, the I just need to decide which route to take. Go via Broken Hill, with lots of space between towns and maybe less traffic, or via Renmark. More towns, but definitely more traffic, and maybe colder?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Broken Hill</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/09/2012-09-08-broken-hill/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-09-08T15:45:00+10:00</published><updated>2012-09-08T15:45:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2012-09-08:/posts/2012/09/2012-09-08-broken-hill/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Eventually had to leave Wilmington.

&lt;p&gt;Did I mention it was dirt. Well, it some places it was grass, no one had been down the road in so long. Certainly was a nice ride. The down side was that with the cold morning, I left late, and then arrived in Orroroo very late.  The lady at the newsagency was nice. But, if you end up down that way, stop in Peterborough, or Wilmington. DO NOT stop or stay in Orroroo. I didn't enjoy the stop in Orroroo, that is all I'll say about the town. I found out heading to Peterborough that there is a free camp on that road. I did ask about free camps, but was told there are none.  If I'd known... Left very early next morning. Broke my don't get up under 5C rule. Was worse as there was a morning fog as well. But by "sun up" (sun didn't actually shine until way late in the day) I  was cycling towards Peterborough and then onto Broken Hill. Was over cold, wet and winds, and more than a bit annoyed over Orroroo, and didn't want to find more towns south like that. I also wanted to see trees again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the trip to Broken Hill didn't have a lot of trees. Lots of space though... But tough for winds. Strong winds were forcast for several days. I was going to stay in Broken Hill until they passed, but then I spoke with the wonderful lady in the information center. There were lots of accomodation options, but Broken Hill is on the Country Link rail network. Rode over to the train station, and dealt with the very very helpful Trevor, at the Country Link booking office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few hours later I was wheeling my bike onto the Indian Pacific and resting in a very comfortable chair. Only 16 hours later, after a  good sleep, I wheeled my bike off the train in Sydney. Indian Pacific train is not a Country Link train, but the bookings are done at the same place. I don't recall the price of Country Link, but $168 seemed to me to be a bargin. Definitely recommend travelling with them.

&lt;p&gt;Hello Megan,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great travels on your bike! Just wondering what size your troll is? I'm 162cm tall and am wondering if the 16 inch is right for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to http://surlybikes.com/bikes/troll and check the Geometry  tab. I used that to pick mine. Checked it against other bikes I had handy. For me the step over height was important - I've short legs and a long torso :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your in Sydney, you could try mine. When I ordered, there were no others around..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, that could be a good idea. Is yours a 16 inch? What is your stand over height?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yep. Mine is a 16inch Surly Troll. Err.. its now "small" in the Surly table. Table lists the stand over height as 744.9mm. (I think this is measured from the center of the actual top tube length.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm running 2" tires. If I measure vertically from the ground up through the crank (this gives a top tube height in front of the seat, as if your standing over the bike), the top of the top tube is about 710mm off the ground.  This leaves me about 80mm clearance without shoes on. So ample clearance to leap off the seat and have feet on the ground and not hit the top tube :)&lt;/p&gt;

Its exciting rediscovering it. New bicycle paths, old ones upgraded. Buildings gone, renovated, demolished and a new building built. Even new roads and bridges in have been laid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still cycling about. The van is handy at times, but bicycle still rules. With paths like this one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you drive?  This is nearby Parramatta Road. Much much nicer than being on Parramatta Road, even in a van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to be staying in Sydney a while. Stuff to do, people to see. I'm expecting I'll get back travelling sometime, but not sure when. And of course I'll be taking the van with the bicycle in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One item I did sort out quickly was seeing a dentist. With the warmer weather the toothache I had has gone away, so thinking it probably was sinus related. But more surprisingly, the three cavities I "needed to have fixed" in Kalgoorlie can't be found. How good is that!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Megan. So I can't call you Bicycle Girl anymore? Maybe BBicycle Van Girl. Glad to hear you made it back to Sydney and are realising some dreams. Good Luck, Mike (From the GCR)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, still have the bicycle and will not stop cycling, but living in the van now. After three years was time for a change. Its nice having more storage space, and being able to carry more food and water.. Plus, sleeping inside in strong winds and rain - mmmmmmm so nice...&lt;/p&gt;

Glad to see that I haven't succumbed to an addiction like I did in Perth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Perth, it started as we're often told it does : "just try it", "only one go, it can't hurt", "here free for your first time".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could it hurt - I wasn't that interested anyway...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon I was short of sleep and sneaking slyly about, seeking out characters with odd sounding names. Searching desperately...  Day, night had no meaning. I just needed to score one more time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to increase my hit...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make my hit stronger...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make my hits hits last longer...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get more hits...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had to be a way...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then as gradually as it started, it faded away. Sense returned. I gave up playing World of Warcraft (WOW to people in the know), got more sleep, and slipped out the door to cycle across the Great Central Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WOW as an addiction was very minor - a few weeks hard at it..  My other addiction, that I fully unleashed the moment I arrived in Perth: junk food, I'd had many many years.  More specifically anything with lots of sugar in it. High fat also featured, but no as much as sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its fair to say that most of my travels were fueled by junk food: cake, chocolate, lollies and my favorite; biscuits (scotch finger biscuits, chocolate chip, orange creams and ginger nuts featured heavily, but I wasn't too picky). I was the person who'd eat dessert  first, and sometimes, second if I didn't like the mains choices, and still have dessert! A family block of chocolate or two. A whole cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tub of icecream. Packets of biscuits for a main meal, no problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, I ate a lot of sugar. A lot like cigarette addiction, I'd tried in the past to cut back, gone cold turkey more than a few times, but always fallen off the wagon.  Looking back, my heart wasn't really in it. One of the reasons that I'd failed in the past was that I figured there was always lots of time left to cut back, so what's the harm in having another cookie now! I can cut back later today, tomorrow, next week, next month, next year... Any time but now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its no surprise that I left Perth more than 10kg heavier than I'd  arrived ; daily cookie consumption, ice cream, chocolate has that effect.  With WOW, junk food, and little exercise, the only surprise was how I didn't gain more weight. And what did all that do to my health?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somewhere about Mingenew (mid June) I decided the time had come reform my eating habits, cut out the sugar and eat more unprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, more fruit and vegetables, but as I discovered they are hard to get in country Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I had to eat my last couple of packets of biscuits first, just start this new eating regime with a clean plate so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't say it was easy. In fact the next two weeks were on and off sugar cravings. Riding along thinking of tim tams, chocolate, scotch finger biscuits, ice cream. I could just about taste them... One thing great about cycling Western Australia - its a long way between places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So cravings with no shops couldn't translate into buying, which would then be followed by eating. I did put in considerable effort to resist in the first few towns. I might have been about to cave in in one small town, but was saved by a limited selection of biscuits. By that time I was a biscuit snob. None of the limited selection would do. I'd resisted so long, I wasn't going to break now just for any old biscuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As time went on, saying "no" got easier and easier, til I didn't have to say "no" any more: I didn't feel the need, so there was nothing to say "no" too.  I could look at all the biscuits, chocolate, lollies, icecream and not feel the need to eat any of them. While at Laverton, the whole dessert section of the all you can eat buffet didn't appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was truly novel experience for me: Megan in an all you can eat dessert buffet and not eating any of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this new awakening, come the realization just how pervasive junk food is. Some roadhouses and information centers that didn't have any healthy food options at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to say that I didn't eat anymore biscuits. I was given a snack pack of two cookies one time. (The travelers insisted.) They tasted so sweet. Like they were more than pure sugar. How'd I ever eat these by the packet full?  Yes I ate them, but I also refused chocolate, snickers bars, tim tams and innumerable other biscuit, cake and lollies offers.  Now I do refuse and in some cases have thrown out junk food forced upon me even after I've said "no thanks" too many times. There is no joy in eating it, and its unhealthy. But there is joy in all the other things I'm eating. Its like the amount of sugar overrode all other tastes. Without it, other tastes have risen up to replace it. There's a whole world of non sugar meals to explore for taste now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad I've broken my sugar addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I know what you mean, it took me a looong loooong time to kick coffee. And the mind plays all sorts of tricks - you know.... It's only when I'm in bad shape that it not good for me. Today I'll just have one etc etc. I don't need it but I'll have one cause it's ok then... Yeah. And after something like 10 years of drinking in in big amounts ie 3-4 daily I came to the conclusion that it's forms a vicious circle in that at some point it ruins your sleep and then ofcourse you need it to stay awake so it ruins you sleep again and then you need afew more to make it through the day.... anyway I willed it down to just one a day. Then I started asking for weak ones - short pour -r risteretto. The rationale being that most of the flavour is in the first part of the pour and the caffeine gradually increases with the max being at the end of a typical pour. But I still sometimes had really bad days ....until one day I said enough of these crap days as a coffe is jus not worth them so I quit! Having great days and feeling great just made coffee seem like a bad deal. And slowly I lost the taste for it...sort of. I still have the occasional dandelion version which is actually good for me. Anyway I haven't had one for years now and really I just don't need it.  We battle with addictions don't we... where do they come from...crap industry via their seductive advertising pushing our buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glad you kicked your sugar thing.&lt;/p&gt;

Been running about sorting out the van to make it livable. While there are many layouts online for most van to camper van conversions, non applied to me. Yep, I'm different. I wanted the bike inside, rather than outside. This changes the layout options. In the end, basically I put a mounting for my bike, and a flat space to sleep on. I've still more space than in my tent. Then all the little things that need to happen - clothing, footwear, storage, cooking gear, etc. Have been using the bicycle camping gear a lot, in the cooking department, but decided I wanted to use LPG and have a good saucepan with a thick copper base with a handle rather than thin light camping pot. Using all the bicycle gear in the sleeping area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to get some work on the van and needed to empty it. I don't have that much more than my cycle gear. More tools (heavy) and more clothes (bulky) were the main areas that grew the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had the work done in Woolongong. Yellow water was running off the rubber around the front windscreen. I was worried about rust under there. Was recommended Bears Auto Hospital. To fix it, the windscreen had to be removed and refitted and they would need the van for three or four days. I'd thought (perhaps naively) that "remove rust around the windscreen" meant the whole windscreen. Alas no. After taking off the windscreen, they fixed one corner and left the rest alone and refitted the windscreen. Not happy. When queried on this, I was told to do the whole window would have been a higher price. Arrrrrggghhh.. Not happy!!!  Will have to revisit this another time at another repair center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, while the van was in, not getting work done, I went off camping again. In true style, it was fine every day except the day I needed to pack up. But a good time was had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used
&lt;a href="http://www.kss.com.au/"&gt;Kennards Storage&lt;/a&gt;
in Woolongong to store my gear. They were excellent. The Woolongong center had only been opened about three weeks earlier. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Totally enjoyed the experience there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While down south, went to the Jerrawangala State Forest/National Park for a short two hour walk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My van didn't have an factory immobilizer and I wanted one. An alarm wasn't much more so I thought: why not? The installer had to cut the wire to measure. Could he spare a few more centimeters of wire?  So rather than having the wiring hidden, I have this to look at on the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll fix this myself at some point. In hindsight, the alarm gives me a warm feeling, but I don't think its that useful overall.&lt;/p&gt;

I much prefer to say how great that are and give compliments. But thinking of the "work" that Bears, I find myself getting angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had Bears Auto Hospital of Woolongong do some work on my van. I cringe to use "work" here as I was ripped off; Really I paid for them for a shoddy job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially when I picked up the van, it was filthy - dust and grit throughout, over the dash, seats and in the rear. They said they run out of time to do any cleaning. On complaining about this, they did offer a free detailing if I'd bring it back to them another day. I was leaving the area, and by this time had seen the windscreen work so, I decided that I wouldn't take them up on that offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time I went back to complain about the dust and grit, I also asked about a small spot of rust in the cargo bay that they said they would fix at the same time as the windscreen. They offered to do it straight away. Arrrrgghhh - their fix was paint over the top of it, without removing the rust that was there!!! This should have clued me up that their other work might not have been the best, but, I left looking at the repairs until now (mid December), and 1000km away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started cleaning it up now. First up was the outside wash; But, I found water dripping in the drivers side under the dash.. oh o... Pulled all the vinyl matting out - it was all damp -  and put the hose on to run water down the windscreen. Yep, water is leaking in on both the drivers and the passenger side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of feeling angry and frustrated, that Bears Auto Hospital removed the windscreen to fix the rust around it and only fixed one corner of the rust, I now have a leaking windscreen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/noglue.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/noglue.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Went to windscreen repair place in Byron, and they said that there wasn't much sealer around the windscreen.. They tried to patch it up, but said that it probably wouldn't work and that the windscreen would have to be removed and refitted. Didn't charge me for trying though.  They were right, the patch didn't work, it still leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bears Auto Hospital quote does say "Rust &lt;strong&gt; around &lt;/strong&gt; front screen".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is around the windscreen. This is the stuff I was paying to get fixed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/win2.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/win2.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/win3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/win1.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/win1.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/win4.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/win4.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the van was in getting the windscreen done, I asked for and got a quote to paint the van floor. Seemed a good idea at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bears didn't remove the rubber grommets before painting, just painted over the top of them. I think they pulled some grommets out, or more likely they were sand blasted away, as this one shows, the ones remaining were painted over. I had pulled some out myself, I'm not 100% sure if the missing grommets are a result of Bears or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/grommet.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/grommet.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this was nothing compared to what I found when I went to change the back door seal. Under the weather strip and rubber seal, where you can't see it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="{static}/images/2013/1-IMG_0671. &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2013/1-IMG_0671.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than two months and its rusting. Bears removed the strip and seal, painted, and put it all back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not one item of the job I had done by Bears Auto Hospital, Woolongong, was done well. The easy to see parts of the job looked okay, until they were more closely examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, Bears has many workers - maybe I was just unlucky to get one that wasn't so switched on that week. However, when I confronted the manager, I could have had a better response than I did. My experience with the work, and dealings with Bears Auto Hospital just leaves me really angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;do not recommend&lt;/strong&gt; Bears Auto Hospital to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The happy ending to this sad tail was that I went to
&lt;a href="http://www.simmonsbyronbay.com.au/pages/byron-bay-panel-beating/"&gt;
Warren Simmons Panel Beating
&lt;/a&gt;
in Byon Bay and he fixed the windscreen and the paint issues. Warren did a excellent job - all the rust sanded away and painted. The windscreen does not leak.  The job was booked in, and the work completed in three days. After the my negative experience with Bears Auto Hospital, dealing with Warren Simmons Panel Beating was wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Mullumbimby - Go Vegan</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2013/01/2013-01-10-mullumbimby-go-vegan/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-10T10:15:00+11:00</published><updated>2013-01-10T10:15:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2013-01-10:/posts/2013/01/2013-01-10-mullumbimby-go-vegan/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still hanging out in Byron area, I was in Mullumbimby - known as Mullum to the locals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. They only do a visual inspection. So, if you can see it, so can they. And to top that all off, they don't even do a good job at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had thought that the "putting the vehicle on the hoist and looking underneath" might show up stuff I couldn't see. In hindsight, I could have just driven spent a bit more time on the ground with a torch and mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking over my van while washing it, I found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Top of back door again - not much paint from the factory.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No mention of this in their visual inspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I missed it also in my looking over, but I'm not a paid professional at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindsight for this was that I should have done more research about what the NRMA inspection is about and what it does and does not do. Maybe if I had of done this I would have saved my money, and just gone on my own visual inspection since the result is that its my problem in the end.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Tenterfield - Gold Coast</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2013/01/2013-01-10-tenterfield-gold-coa/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-01-10T10:43:00+11:00</published><updated>2013-01-10T10:43:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2013-01-10:/posts/2013/01/2013-01-10-tenterfield-gold-coa/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sat out the Xmass and New Years period in a bush camp up near Tenterfield.

&lt;p&gt;First item of business was to get the van serviced. I mentioned to the guy that recommended Bears Auto Clinic for getting my windscreen fixed that they did a terrible job. (&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2013/01/2013-01-10-a-real-shoddy-job-by/"&gt;See here&lt;/a&gt; for the full story.) He immediately called up Bears and spoke to them, then told me to go around and talk with them. So I did. I didn't expect much from this. As I complained when I picked the van up about only fixing part of the windscreen and not all of it. Was told then that it would have cost more to fix all the window, even though the quote has "Rust around front screen" on it. Not: rust on bottom of windscreen. So, went around and spoke with Michael (again) at Bears. He was all sorry that I'd had a bad experience, blamed everyone else: the window installers (leaking windows), and the paint suppliers (rust started within a month of the paint inside the van), and promised to call me back after speaking to them. That was last Thursday morning.  Lets say I'm still waiting for his call.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2013/04/2013-04-28-sydney/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-04-28T16:56:00+10:00</published><updated>2013-04-28T16:56:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2013-04-28:/posts/2013/04/2013-04-28-sydney/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The weather in Sydney the last few days has been wonderful.

Yeah, I wasn't rushing at all. Stopped several times for a break.  Just cruised along gently along the Putty Road. I thought it was very scenic.  Day dreamed about cycling along it.. I still having bicycle withdrawal symptoms. Still got my bike with me in the van though. And do get out and ride it. But not the same as days touring. Trade offs...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well its cooler up high. Temps been dropping to 3C overnight. And had a few light showers. No problems in the metal tent for water getting in, but it has been a bit tough getting up and moving early.   I have found condensation down low in the van - on the bottom of bottles and tins in my storage system. I'm not sure if this is from my breathing in the van - without the window open, or just from travelling from low areas to high areas with cooler temps, and not adequate ventilation to dry it out. I opened out the storage area and it all dried up, but the next night it was back again. Will need to keep an eye on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the cooler weather, I dropped down to the coast for a night near Byron Bay. Much warmer at 18C.  Seemed lots of angry people about when I was lunching in the park. Guys yelling aggressively at one another. Pushing, shoving, name calling, lots of expletives. Uncomfortable to be around, so I didn't. Diving out, passing the servo another blue in progress. Yicks - what was it with Sunday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now staying with friends for a few days on the Gold Coast before deciding if to just head up the coastal road, or to track inland for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

Wiper blades froze onto the windscreen and don't move. The water washer also froze. Ice is very abrasive - I now need new windscreen wipers..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The taps outside froze solid - so check for running water before taking off your clothes for a shower.  My van is unheated - so stuff inside froze also.   More than one blanket was needed.  Getting up and running to the shower block in thongs was guaranteed to give you frozen feet before you arrived.  Leaving the shower, wet hair froze on the run back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was to have been an easy casual position: waitress/kitchen-hand. But that quickly changed and I found myself with the title 'Manager', planning, directing staff, and making changes.  Looking back on the time now, it was fun and exciting. Long hours but ultimately rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was only to have been working for a couple weeks, but ended up extending my time to a couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;

Along with replacing the steep concrete sides with a more natural rock bank, the non native willow trees will be replaced with natives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, definitely progress :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I does look good but it would surely be better if they found a way to retain the trees. In this expedient days trees are often seen as easily replaceable and in a local blinkered view they are. The trouble starts as we widen our view and realise that each one of these was probably 20 years old and somewhere  else out of our view another similar tree has just been yanked out and transplanted. The result is still a 50% loss ie we could have had two trees absorbing carbon, providing habitat and soon there will only be one. :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went back recently and there is a sign up explaining the tree removal. So I wasn't the only one wondering. Yes some of the non natives are being removed, but they claim 80,000 natives will be planted to replace them.  I wondered how they counted them all..&lt;/p&gt;

.  They fruit about the same time.) I'm lucky that I find them pleasant smelling. Other people aren't so lucky. In Asia, some hotels and public transport ban them. I ate mine outside, sitting in the garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walking about town isn't the same as out bush, so headed for a walk down in "The Royal".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking on the
&lt;a href="http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/nationalparks/region.aspx?name=Sydney-region"&gt;National Parks website&lt;/a&gt;
, the walk I did is listed as the
&lt;a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/royal-national-park/karloo-walking-track/walking"&gt;Karloo&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/royal-national-park/uloola-walking-track/walking"&gt;Uloola&lt;/a&gt;
walking tracks.  They have the distance for Uloola listed as 10km, but is more like 5. Another site list
&lt;a href="http://short-walks.com.au/new-south-wales/sydney/uloola-track-heathcote-to-waterfall/"&gt;Uloola&lt;/a&gt;
as going from Heathcote to Waterfall which would be about 10km. So there is a bit of confusion there on naming or distance. The National Parks rate both as "medium difficulty". I rate it (Heathcote to Waterfall) as an
&lt;a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/bludge"&gt;bludge&lt;/a&gt;
walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was disappointed at the the state of Karloo Pool. Looked like some people had camped or partied there - so smashed beer bottles, half burnt plastic and trash left behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sitting about at Uloola Falls, a couple of joggers turned up. One guy surprised me by drinking from the stream. He reckoned it tasted "just like water". Not sure what that means - as pure water is tasteless. That water was certainly not pure. And while the water looks clear, I wouldn't trust drinking it - especially in the Royal! Clear flowing water is not safe to drink. The bugs that cause illness are tiny - you can't see them.  His mate didn't seem keen on him drinking it either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new year I'll be on the road again (More on this in another post). With that in mind I started testing my gear out. Some of it hasn't rested well. First time using the MSR stove, fuel sprayed out of the adjustment knob. Seals had gone hard with age. I suspect that the heat of inside the van didn't help them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to worry. Had this happen before and it was soon fixed and a great meal cooked up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had hoped to do some hiking, but having troubles with a sore back. Even when carrying a light day pack. Its only when carrying a pack. Cycling is no problem. In fact, cycling seems to make it better. So, going to give the hiking idea away for the moment and continue with cycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will be staying in Sydney for the Xmas period. I have some things to do early in the near year, and traveling outwards from Sydney at Xmas time with all the crowds heading out for holidays, finding a spot close by, and then travelling back with the crowds doesn't appeal to me.  With all the people that leave, Sydney will be quiet. So I'll stay about a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2013/12/2013-12-19-colgate-maximum-cavi/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-12-19T10:03:00+11:00</published><updated>2013-12-19T10:03:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2013-12-19:/posts/2013/12/2013-12-19-colgate-maximum-cavi/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a post I started late last year.

Its been resting in 'Drafts' for some time. As part of the clean up for the end of this year, I've just finished the references and here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was looking my tube of toothpaste: Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection.  There is a little drop with 'Liquid Calcium" written underneath the writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not the first to wonder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://fortheluvofscience.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/liquid-calcium-wait-really/"&gt;http://fortheluvofscience.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/liquid-calcium-wait-really/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=8792"&gt;http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=8792&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://metabunk.org/threads/1213-Toothpaste-Liquid-calcium"&gt;http://metabunk.org/threads/1213-Toothpaste-Liquid-calcium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim of 'liquid calcium' had me thinking. It sounds like it is giving calcium to your teeth - which would be a good thing. But
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"&gt;Calcium melts at 842 Celsius&lt;/a&gt;
, so that claim is clearly not true. Maybe they mean that it provides calcium ions in solution when your brushing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to check this out. The "active" ingredients on the tube do not list calcium in it at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine print on the tube refers you to
&lt;a href="http://www.colgate.com.au/"&gt;www.colgate.com.au&lt;/a&gt;
for more information. But there is no more information shown for Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking about the Australian site for Colgate, there isn't very much information besides the advertising spiel. Even for their Colgate Total range, which they did have an option for "more information" only gives more advertising speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Australian product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INGREDIENTS Active:&lt;br&gt;
Active Ingredients: per tube: Sodium monofluorophosphate 0.76% W/W, Sodium fluoride 0.10% W/W&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on the back is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingredients: Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate, water, sorbitol, sodium lauryl sulfate, cellulose gum, flavor, Sodium monofluorophosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium saccharin, Sodium fluoride, CL 42090 
&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The First ingredient is calcium. Dicalcium - looks promising.
&lt;a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/di-#Prefix"&gt;Di&lt;/a&gt;, being the prefix meaning two. Twice the calcium? But, don't be fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, a quick rundown on tooth decay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dental decay is when the rate of minerals lost from the teeth exceed the rate they are deposited. Bacteria break down foods, and release acid, which erodes the enamel causing  minerals to be lost. Saliva washes the acid away, and provides calcium ions to replace the mineral lost, restoring the enamel. Acidic foods also demineralize the teeth, just like excessive vomiting. Tooth enamel can also be lost by excessive abrasion - brushing too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at all the ingredients:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicalcium_phosphate"&gt;Dicalcium phosphate dihydrate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
does not provide any calcium ions as its classed as practically insoluble in water.  In toothpaste it used as a tartar control agent.  What this means is that it is an abrasive.  Rubbing between the toothbrush and your teeth will grind off any tartar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is used to provide a form of calcium in food: breakfast cereals, enriched flour and noodles. But the calcium here is available after digestive acids have acted on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva"&gt;saliva&lt;/a&gt;
is 99.5% water, not much is going to dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"&gt;Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
- Depends on the water. If its pure water its not going to have any calcium in it, but assuming its a normal drinking water source, it is a possibility that there might be some calcium in it. See below under 'flavour'. The water could have "processing aids" in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbitol"&gt;sorbitol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
- Is a sugar substitute, a thickener, that also retains moisture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_lauryl_sulfate"&gt;sodium lauryl sulfate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
-   Used as a surfactant. Interestingly, a
&lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2696932"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;
has suggested that it could be decreasing the effectiveness of fluoride in toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduces sweetness - as seen when having sweets after using toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxymethyl_cellulose"&gt;cellulose gum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
-   Also known as Carboxymethyl cellulose, but cellulose gum sounds better. Used as a thickener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;flavour&lt;/em&gt;  - no idea what this is, as it is not required to be disclosed. Australia only requires that if a flavor or flavoring is used that it is
&lt;a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00264"&gt;listed as 'flavouring' or 'flavour'&lt;/a&gt;
.  Since the toothpaste is 'cool mint' flavour, its 'cool mint' of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually reading the Australian New Zealand food standards is an enlightening process. "Processing aids" do not have to appear in the ingredients list.
&lt;a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013C00139"&gt;This standard&lt;/a&gt;
lists off all the acceptable aids used that don't have to be listed as an ingredient:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;antifoam agents&lt;br&gt;
catalysts&lt;br&gt;
decolourants, clarifying, filtration and adsorbent agents&lt;br&gt;
desiccating preparations&lt;br&gt;
ion exchange resins&lt;br&gt;
lubricants, release and anti-stick agents&lt;br&gt;
carriers, solvents and diluents&lt;br&gt;
processing aids used in packaged water and in water used as an ingredient in other foods&lt;br&gt;
bleaching agents, washing and peeling agents&lt;br&gt;
extraction solvents&lt;br&gt;
enzymes of animal origin&lt;br&gt;
enzymes of plant origin&lt;br&gt;
enzymes of microbial origin&lt;br&gt;
microbial nutrients and microbial nutrient adjuncts&lt;br&gt;
Dimethyl dicarbonate as a microbial control agent&lt;br&gt;
and finally processing aids with miscellaneous functions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some agents have a limit for how much can appear in the food. For most of the agents, the amount used is listed as "GMP" (Good Manufacturing Practice).  I cannot find a definition of that, but it seems to be to only use enough to get the job done. I didn't find anything that said how much that is either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_monofluorophosphate"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sodium monofluorophosphate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
is the active ingredient, and is providing fluoride ions. It has been found that fluoride in the remineralization makes a more acid resistant enamel. So this is not a bad thing. The amount in toothpaste is less than 1%.  Each 175 gram tube has 1.3 grams in it. Not much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makes me wonder just how much are you getting when using a small amount of toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrasodium_pyrophosphate"&gt;tetrasodium pyrophosphate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
- is used as a buffering agent, an emulsifier, a dispersing agent and a thickener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In toothpaste its used for tartar control by removing calcium and magnesium from saliva to stop them being deposited on the teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharin"&gt;sodium saccharin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
- An artificial sugar substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_fluoride"&gt;Sodium Fluoride&lt;/a&gt;
Provides fluoride ions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brilliant_Blue_FCF"&gt;CL 42090&lt;/a&gt;
A color agent. Provides the blue color to toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this toothpaste&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does not provide any calcium at all, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is removing the calcium in your saliva&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It'll be a few more days yet before I'm listing the van on the car sales websites, but the van is for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big changes are afoot. It is not new year resolution stuff. I've been thinking about this for the past few months. Just have been sitting on the idea and thinking a lot. Also, with Christmas and New Year happening, I thought that it was not the best time to be selling. I have used some of the time to start cleaning up. I've just spent part of today going through all the stuff I've accumulated, (How'd I get so much?) sorting it into heaps - going with me, going to sell, going to give away, going to trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, selling the van - what next?  A return to the bicycle and the tent. Time to hit the road again and keep exploring the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I bought the van, I'd decided it was time for a change. I'd thought long and hard about it. Bike touring isn't always bliss and pleasure, sometimes its really hard. At the time, weighing up the data, giving everything equal weight, a van seemed the best decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where I failed, was the weightings of those decisions comparing living in the tent and the van. It was hard to weigh some of them without having had lived in a van before. Now I have, and looking back on those decisions, I weigh them differently now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many good points for living in a van. Certainly some people are very happy living in a van. But for me, I don't want to keep doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If home is where the heart is, then my heart isn't in the van. Its outside, under the sky, in the wind, rain, fog and sun. Hearing the birds, and the rustle of wind in the trees.  Feeling the rain drops on my face. Inhaling the sweet honey smell of the eucalyptus, sensing the cool riding into the morning mists. Its outside, active, being in the environment, rather than watching it pass by out the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I miss riding my bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My fitness declined in the past year. I was reminded of this last week, when I rode from the city to Hornsby. I set out just before lunch, a couple hours, I'll eat when I get there. The first half was easy, then I started feeling tired. It was hot - the heatwave. The sensible thing would have been to stop, rest, have lunch, but I was focusing on arriving first. I pushed on, into the hills. Soon I hit the wall, and a little later while I was down, the wall fell on me. I was shattered. Even walking was an effort. I was so glad when I could lie down.  I slept well that night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was up at 3:30am - couldn't sleep. Wasn't leaving for another 4 hours, and most was packed. Packing up the tent, the only worry I had was "where did that spider go..."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything fits back in the panniers - so well, that I wonder if I've forgotten anything. So I grabbed a few extras just in case. Now it looks suitably full. Probably end up ditching the stuff later..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to quirks of Cityrail, travelling today (Sunday) has less train changes, larger cross over times at the changes and is an hour faster than travelling tomorrow. Cause, that all depended on the trains running "on time". Since

&lt;/u&gt;
ityRail defines "ontime" as "within 10 minutes of the time table" it means that making connections is iffy.&lt;/p&gt;

A non trafficked route to Jenolan Caves. Quiet. Scenic. The map showed bicycles allowed on it been Megalong Valley Road and Jenolan Caves Road. I could then continue touring southwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's downhill from Blackheath to the track start. There I chatted with some walkers, returning from the Cox River. They were tired, having abandoned their walk to Jenolan and turned back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high hopes, I rode off. The first kilometre was on a road, then the track started. This was the last I rode for the next three days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I expected some walking would be involved. Crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge involves stairs... The track was rough, narrow, rocky with stairs, fences and gates. Considerable effort was required. After a while I continued on in the hope it would improve. It didn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portage over the rougher spots, stairs and fences involved up to six trips. The river crossing also was exciting. Do you carry over the important stuff first? Or gain practice first? Is anything not important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd optimistically planned on making the second camp site, but was sufficiently exhausted to stay at the Coxs. The camp that night was quiet. I was the only one, after the last of the 4x4's left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road resumed from the camp site. It goes up, and up, and up. After four hours pushing up hill, I pulled the pin and walked back to the Coxs. I'd managed just over 1km/hr. It was hot, and I wouldn't have had enough water to get out. And at that point I was still less than half way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No 4x4s when you want one..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only alternative was back the way I'd come. 6.5km of it. While it was three hours down, going back would take longer as it would be uphill. It only took me 5 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ride/walk back up Megalong Valley Road seemed easy after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd say the Six Foot Track is a mountain biking track, rather than loaded tourer riding track. Though it would be easier starting from the Jenolan end; more hills from that side.&lt;/p&gt;

After that, road to Glen Davis, then passed through Glen Alice, Rylstone,  Bylong and Muswellbrook. An easy ride to places I've been before. Was nice to be out on the road again. Predictably I struggled with fitness, but did manage a 100km day without too much effort. I needed to return to Sydney for some personal matters, but also because my gear was falling apart; tent leaking, stove leaking fuel and bike breaking spokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black spokes; a mistake on my last wheel build. When wet, the water sits where the spokes cross, and they rust. Weakened, then snap at the cross over point.  New spokes are double butted, stainless steel. No rust!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stove; I changed seals and wanted to get a replacement. Ended up getting a bit of an overhaul and more than one seal changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tent; It was still under warranty. Exped replaced the tent with the newer version of the same model. Neat. Its a bit lighter as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that took care of the gear. I've done some house sitting, house repairs, and had a dose of the flu.&lt;/p&gt;

On antibiotics that are working really well. I'm wondering why I put up with it for so long! Though, either the infection or the antibiotics are making me really tried. Only managed 50 km today.

One of the great things about cycling is that you can talk with a lot of people and this day, I spoke with several; the retired truck driver, clearing the weeds from his driveway with an old hoe, the old man and his son, working to repair their 4x4 on their way up to the Cape,  an retired office worker, enjoying being outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;All day, these tiny flowers beside the road for me to enjoy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also the climb over the range to get past. I didn't cycle much of it. Was very tired all day, so walked a lot.  But still managed to get into Wallabadah about 2pm.  Another 50km day, into a headwind, and I wasn't feeling that energetic.  At that time I  had the whole camp ground to myself to decide where to set up.  In the end I sheltered in the trees, even though the wind had stopped by sundown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke at midnight to the roar of the wind in the trees, and patter of rain on the tent. Felt glad that I'd chosen the sheltered spot. That was the scene for the day though - wind and lots of it. The rain threatened, but stayed away. I wanted to have another short day, but ended up in Gunnadah. 100km and there was nothing to hide behind. Cotton fields with ankle high grass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunnahah was surprisingly large. I'd expected a smaller town, instead it manages a Coles and Woolworths.  It was basically arrive, find a tent site and sleep. I was exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort to arrive spent me. Heading towards Barraba 80km away, I managed a measly 40k before calling it quits beside the road. Just didn't have the energy to do more that day.  So had a short day, resting in the sun. The wind of the previous day had gone. It seemed a shame to have such a nice day and feel so weak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 40km into Barraba was a struggle.  So, I've decided to rest here a few days to see if I can regain my strength. I'm hoping that now that the course of antibiotics is over things will improve.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Shitake mushrooms</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/06/2014-06-04-shitake-mushrooms/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-04T07:28:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-06-04T07:28:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-06-04:/posts/2014/06/2014-06-04-shitake-mushrooms/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finished the packet of Shitake mushrooms yesterday.

&lt;p&gt;DO NOT CONSUME"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That sinking feeling... I've not seen that sachet. Fishing frantically through the days stew didn't find it. I'd not seen it on any other days. But I wasn't looking for it then either. Pour in, quick careless stir, lid on till it boils, cool and eat. Not noticed it. What would out look like after a boil? Couldn't have tasted too bad.. Maybe this packet missed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe that was why I want feeling the best a few days..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I was in in North Star the caravan park had closed. So I camped outside of town. That's now changed and its reopened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was recovered from whatever was ailing me previously, but still wasn't making large daily distances. Previous rides through here had longer daylight hours. Winter: the sun rises at 7am, and is gone at 5pm. So I worked out my days to match. Averaged a relaxing 80km a day.  Passed locations of previous camps, and had to find new spots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just daily cycling. Empty mind at times. Enjoying the sun, sounds, sights and smells..&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>A short cut: Bauhinia Downs, Rollestone, Springsure, Emerald, Capella, Clermont, Belyano Crossing, Charters Towers</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/06/2014-06-14-a-short-cut-bauhinia/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-14T14:18:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-06-14T14:18:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-06-14:/posts/2014/06/2014-06-14-a-short-cut-bauhinia/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Was wanting to have a rest in Tarrom, but didn't like the look of the caravan park.

So headed out. Thought I'd head to Theodore and stay a couple of days, but at the last moment decided to take a 110km gravel road shortcut towards Springsure and rest there instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "short cut" turned a hard slog, that had me wondering if it was such a great idea after all. Gravel road I was told. Gravel road describes anything that isn't covered in tar; from hard packed smooth dirt to deep beach sand, to large cobble sized rocks embedded in rock. The short cut turned out to have the latter.  80km of bone shaking rattling over rocks, with regular oscillations requiring "get off and push". Couldn't even enjoy the downhills because of the rocks, and in the few places the rocks didn't exist, the road was getting bull dust pits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Historical Site found about 80km from the Tarrom end of the Fitzroy Development Road&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But eventually the last 30km come good for me, and it was out to Bauhinia Downs, were I scored a lift with a road train to Rollestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd decided that since I was covering ground that I'd already cycled many times before up to Cairns, that if anyone offered a lift, I'd take it. So, when the driver offered, I accepted. Bike tied at the end of the load, a long long way back, off we went. Certainly a different view from up high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I arrived in Rollestone so early, I called the rest of a the day a rest day and checked into the caravan park for a washing day. Sadly that night the fire alarm in a nearby locked caravan/cabin started squeaking the low battery warning.  It did mean I was up early to leave...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy cycling through Springsure. Stopped to chat with a broken down truckie. He asked if I had any water. Unfortunately my measly 3 litres wasn't going to top up his system after a broken heater pipe. Since I also lacked a spare pipe and cooling fluid, he had to wait for the repair truck to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another truckie stopped a bit later up the road - two flat tires.  I couldn't help him either. There was some muttering about Friday 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passing through Emerald was non eventful. Just a quick stop for food, then kept going out of town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light showers, 20km from Capella, Luke in his ute pulled over to offer me a lift. I accepted again. Had an extra hour to sit about for lunch and clean the mud off.  I thoughtlessly stepped off the road into a recently dug hole. Sank to my ankles in mud.  Cleaned it up, but repeated the trick later that day looking for a road side camp. Finally got all the mud off in Clermont.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left Clermont, minus mud, but with a lot of food; I blame it on shopping when hungry. Should never do that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the day out of Clermont, when I wanted to camp, there was a 20km stretch that had four cars run off the road and crashed. One had rolled several times and jumped the fence near the road. All late model cars. Tired drivers?  I didn't know, but found a spot a kilometre from the road that night and each other night. Wasn't taking chances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy riding till past Belyando Crossing. I'd stopped at a rest stop to have a snack, when a road train pulled up with empty, cattle trailers. Got talking with the driver, and he offered a lift into Charters Towers, where he would then head west.  Tied the bike in the cattle trailer and off we went.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Reid River, Townsville, Paluma National Park, Jourama Falls, Cardwell</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/06/2014-06-22-reid-river-townsvill/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-22T15:09:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-06-22T15:09:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-06-22:/posts/2014/06/2014-06-22-reid-river-townsvill/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Leaving Charters Towers I camped at the Burdekin River.

&lt;p&gt;The tire was a bit flat, so I put the pump on it and added air. Seemed like it was leaking about the valve, but then stopped.  So I rode about for a couple of days. Then a few days later, it was flat again.  Thinking a puncture, I pulled it out, and was surprised when the valve come away in my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking closely at the valve, it looks like it never bonded well. I can push the valve stem into the hole and it does a good job of sealing it - but must slowly leak. Wondering if I can clean the metal up and use some glue and reclaim the tube.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>On no, not another downhill</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/08/2014-08-27-on-no-not-another-do/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-08-27T14:15:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-08-27T14:15:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-08-27:/posts/2014/08/2014-08-27-on-no-not-another-do/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Left the coast angry and unhappy.

Anger propelled me halfway up the range, but left me without worn out and tired the next day. A lot of walking ensured.  Usually when I'm up this way its wet and cold. That was not the case now.  Bright blue sky and baking sun. Oh for some coolness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The range seemed to have grown from last time. For every up hill walk, there was a flying downhill coast. But that just meant another long uphill walk. Before long I was groaning with each downhill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just outside of Ravenshoe in the rest area, I met Geoff from Towoomba:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His Penny is from 1882, and travels with him. He was kind enough to give me a beer and a ride. Been a long time since I've sat on one, and I was glad to get back to my safety bike afterwards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day it hit 32C. I suffered badly. Tiredness, headache, and then nausea feeling. It took a bit for me to realise that I wasn't drinking enough. Soon as I did, I was off the road, in the shade and force drinking.  Was a timely reminder to be aware of the conditions.  With the temps above 30C from now on, I decided on 30minute drink breaks. Been going well since then. Also toned down the effort so not sweating also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stayed a night in Mt Surprise. Met Shane - also on a cycle there. He'd started in Darwin. With a $10 a night camp fee for bicycles, I had to stay. Also ate four burgers and got to listen to Russels' snake talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just outside Georgetown I got a flat :(  It had been a sleepless night with gusty winds. I'd started early, but then spent hours on the side of the road. The flat wasn't  puncture. I'd been told that I should run my tires at a lower PSI, so was experimenting with that.  I'll stick with higher pressures from now on. It looked like the bead of the tire was rubbing on the rim. It rubbed through to the wire, which then punctured the tube. It had been that way for a while - the wire was rusty and the rim tape was also stained. Closer examination showed the tube being slowly cut by the rim tape where the rust had stained it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucky I had spare rim tape and a spare tire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except I couldn't get the tire to sit on the rim right. It would have a flat spot on it. That felt like a bump when cycling. Most uncomfortable.  Finally I worked it out. The old rim tape is about 17mm, the new one was 22mm. So I sat and cut with scissors 2mm off one side, and 3mm off the other side to narrow it down. Then the tire sat right.  No more bump or flat spot on the tire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the time sitting on the side of the road, I still managed a healthy distance. The wind was still blowing, so propelled me along just nicely. The only downside was trying to keep cool; it seemed like I was cycling in still air.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Croydon, Normanton</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/08/2014-08-27-croydon-normanton/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-08-27T14:41:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-08-27T14:41:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-08-27:/posts/2014/08/2014-08-27-croydon-normanton/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sitting at the table in Croydon, having lunch, I spied another cycle rider in the distance.

In the wavering heat it looked like he was hunch backed. I waited, but he stopped at the shop. Impatient I rode down to see who it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I met, who I'll call the Mad German. He looked a bit like Santa Claus, the thinner version, but after he'd been pulled on the sled through the bush, on a typically Aussie Christmas day. Bits of leaf, dust and salt matted his face, hair and clothes. He couldn't stop still; like a flea on a hot plate. He was also very busy with the camera. We talked for a few minutes. I got from him that he was doing about 150km a day, had ridden across the Barkley Tablelands, and wanted to get on to Canberra and Melbourne.  He had his holiday and was in a rush.  He'd also travelled a lot overseas. Then with a wave, he was off. I'd not even gotten his name.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hunch back appearance in the distance was the backpack he had on. Not sure what was in it though. He carried 10 litres of water to my 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he left, I had a look at myself in the bike mirror. Hmmm. We probably didn't look that different. To fix that I had a quick splash of water over my face in the toilet block, raked out my hair and washed out my shirt. It dried in less than 5 minutes. I felt better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now its a rest day in Normanton. When I planned to come out here it was a nice 25C max. Now as I look at the weather forecast, I think I've run out of cool weather.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>People..</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/08/2014-08-27-people/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-08-27T14:52:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-08-27T14:52:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-08-27:/posts/2014/08/2014-08-27-people/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Was feeling a bit down a couple of mornings ago when I started cycling for the day.

Then kept waking all night. So at 3am, decided to do something about all the cool, still weather. Packed up and I was off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the sun peeked over the horizon, I saw that I was on a sea of golden brown grass. With the increased light, increased wind. Sailing I was. Not the skip across the wave tops type, nor the lazing about on deck with a glass of something alcoholic. This was the labouring into the wind type of sailing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2014/seaofbrown.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img  src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2014/seaofbrown.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd managed 50km by sun up. Three hours - not bad. The next 50 took 5 hours. A much slower pace.  I had two car drivers stop. One gentleman, whose name escapes me now, picked me up with tea and lamingtons. A real life saver. I'd been feeling not the best still. But after this, I was almost back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next driver to stop was Jim of Free Scotland. His gift was stuff from heaven; cashews, peanuts and dried banana chips. Thanks Jim - they lasted two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd called it quits for the day not long after waving off Jim. Too hot. Found a solitary bush to shelter behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day, was a repeat; without the early rising, or the drivers stopping. A steady day of 15km/hr into the wind was itinerary. Seven hours to the Burke and Wills Roadhouse for a couple of burgers. Avoid being trampled at the counter by large mammalian creatures, then on another hour to find a campsite away from the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprise the next day was a repeat. Steady day of pedalling into head winds. I tried a few times if walking was faster; no. I also tried tacking across the road. Seemed to help, but then it didn't.  Just keep pedalling..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might be sounding monotonous, but it was steady days of cycling at 15km/hr into the wind. Yep, its windy and all directions I want to go, are into it. The land around here is big open flat planes. Nothing to hide behind, nothing to stop the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ended up camped near a creek, that had a bit of water in a few holes. Watched all the birds come for a drink. With 33C temps, and windy, its hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soak it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yep, it worked. Soaked overnight, it was edible in the morning.  If I waited until evening, it started fermenting though. Still edible - just a bit fizzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add milk powder, or curry and yum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water is sweet, the pasta a bit tasteless..  That is what the milk powder or curry is for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Found the same with my breakfast - rolled oats, desiccated coconut and dried dates.  Best to eat it before lunch.  By the evening, its fermenting. Again still edible, just a bit fizzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use peanut butter jar to soak food in. When the food starts fermenting, the containers swell - so could leak. Make sure they are standing upright in the panniers..&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sheltering from the wind in Julia Creek</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/09/2014-09-03-sheltering-from-the-/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-03T11:31:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-09-03T11:31:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-09-03:/posts/2014/09/2014-09-03-sheltering-from-the-/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Another blusterious day.

&lt;p&gt;Sheltering with a magpie. It's been singing non stop; probably complaining about the wind. Or, maybe that I'm not providing any food. I've enough of my own problems there. The spare tire around my waist has migrated downwards. As the legs have grown, the appetite has soared. Stocked up yesterday for today, and promptly ate it all this morning for breakfast. Another shop is needed if I'm not to eat the cycling rations. Better do that while there is a shop. Next one will be in Winton, three long days pedal away. And more headwinds and heat is forecast.&lt;/p&gt;

It was a cold morning, and I had delayed starting. Only 117km, no worries. Until the wind blew up, the temperature soared, and I flagged. Then to top it all off, in the hottest part of the day, the rear tire went flat!  What? A new tire, it doesn't puncture! It hadn't. The tube had a patch and it had separated. Darn. Patched it again without taking the wheel off, loaded up, pffffttt. The new patch didn't stick. At this point I took the wheel off and replaced the tube with a patch free one. All this in the blazing sun, flies and dust. Not sure if the glue was off or it was just too hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a new tube of glue, in the cooler evening I patched the tube again to keep for a spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next rise, and I met a lovely couple with a camper trailer having a break on the side of the road. They topped me up with water, so I could skip riding into Kynuna, and head straight to Winton. A 10km saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ended up camped near the road, behind a bush about 100km from Julia Creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure no one could see me here :-)&lt;/p&gt;

The moon is out, but it's not showing enough light to help me. My torch just doesn't have the power either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day had started so well. Packed and on the road early. I'd found a screwdriver, some spanners (imperial, left them behind) and a battery drill (still working). And I met Noel and Moreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd briefly meet at the Burke and Wills roadhouse. A quick chat, they where on their way to Lawn Hill National Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recognized me stopped having a snack, turned around, and came back to say hello. What's more, I was invited into their (motor)home for a cup of caffeine, and one of Noels home made fruit tarts. Out off the wind, I heard about their trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most roadside stops are me answering twenty questions, before I hear, "got to go now, bye". So was lovely to hear about their travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it was the coffee, tart, conversation, rest, or dropping off the battery drill, I had good travels afterwards. As the sun fell, I passed a gate. In I went 100 meters to some bushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That night I didn't sleep well, so at 1:30 decided to get up, pack up, and night ride. No wind, it was cooler. Moon out. Almost perfect. I headed back to the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2:30, I admit I'm lost. Can't find the gate. I've pushed almost a one km now, through two drains! I was only 100m from it when the sun set. Now I'm at a fence, I can see the road, I give up on the gate. Unpack the bike, lift it all over, repack, push through the grass, remembering Russ's Mt Surprise snake talk. Is it better to push through the bundles, or steer for a path? I push through the bundles making lots of noise to scare snakes away, and to avoid any death adders waiting on the path for prey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the road, I jump on. One turn of the pedals and stop. Unpack the bike again. Panniers on wrong side and hitting my feet. Finally I'm ready. Now I begin to doubt myself. Am I going the right way? The GPS doesn't completely clear things up. It's only when I see new road signs that I'm happy I'm going the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winton arrives at 7 am. I eat breakfast, look about. Very touristy. I don't want to stay. By 9 I've restocked and am rolling out of town. The plan was 30 km, find some shade and rest. But the wind died down! Oh, to not have a headwind. Then puffs of a tail wind. I had to keep going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2 pm, the headwind was back, and I wanted to stop, but nothing to hide behind. Just empty grass plains. It was 4pm when I came to some bushes and finally stopped.10 hours cycling time, 170km. A big day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drifted off to sleep watching the tiny spiders on the tent mesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At midnight I awoke, to tired, back to sleep. At 3 I was up and going again. No getting lost this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I regretted not starting at midnight. The headwind picked up with the light. The last 40 km into Longreach was very windy. But time passes, and I arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting having lunch, I notice I've more freckles. Arrrgghh ticks, not tiny spiders!! Time to rest, de-tick, and plan where to next.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Isisford, via the "shortcut"</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/09/2014-09-10-isisford-via-the-sho/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-10T13:19:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-09-10T13:19:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-09-10:/posts/2014/09/2014-09-10-isisford-via-the-sho/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The GPS shows its only 107 km, Longreach to Isisford.

I set of to explore. Four hours later, 45 km of dirt roads and I'm talking with Mark about the road. Lucky for me, Mark was checking the dams, else I was on a long trip back to Longreach the way I had come. The road was the old postal route. Long gone. Mark said I was only 6km from the road to Jundah. I decide to take that, and emerge 18 km from where I started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All up the trip to Isisford takes me 150km. Longer than any option provided by the GPS or
&lt;u&gt;
map
&lt;/u&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it was country. And no traffic. Just nice dirt roads, cows, sheep, emus and roos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving, I learn its a public holiday for the Barcaldine show. Nothing open. Oh well, tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

The night before, I might have invited him in for dinner. Must sense when someone is hungry, and its safe to visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next day I'm cycling happily along the road. The wind is playing with me. It pretends to not notice me, and I wind up the speed. Then it pounces back and knocks me down to crawling pace. I laugh out loud. Its such a beautiful day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I'm staring in my own concert. I sing and my audience is happy. Well, they are not flying away, so I call that happy. I'm quiet good really.&lt;/p&gt;

We've had an uneasy relationship. They scurry up my legs as fast as they can. I try to spot them and flick them off. No matter how many I spot, I always had the feeling some were avoiding my gaze.  I got good at pinching the spots I couldn't see and picking them off. But the were always more. Finally, enough!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped early, and sprayed my tent, ground sheets, straps, ocky cords, shoes, socks, only the below the knees of my pants. I smell like a dipped sheep. But no more ticks! It was with great satisfaction I found dead ones in the tent this morning. As they keep climbing out of my gear, they will all die.  The only down side of this - besides smelling of a dipped sheep - is that at times my water seems to taste the same. Small price to pay I decide. I sleep well at night now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing south, I pass the Dog Fence. Though, I'm sure I saw dogs on either side of it. Not sure how useful it is really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally join the Mitchell Highway, 20km outside of Augathella. Sure the highway would have been quicker, but no where near as scenic or as much fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to stay the night in Charleville. The sheep dip taste in my water and food was getting to me. I was going to ignore it some more, but then talking with a guy outside the IGA, he mentioned there was a strong sheep dip smell, and that I was the cause of it. Soon as he said 'sheep dip' I knew it was me. Bought some more soap, and went to find a caravan park to wash in.  Really annoying actually, as the poison is odourless and tasteless. Its just the "flavour" that gives it the awful smell and taste. Why can't they make it strawberry or banana? So the agenda for the day was wash everything - tent, bedding, clothing, ground sheets, water bags, bags, bottles, etc.. Yep, everything. The stuff didn't have any smell on my clothes when dry, but when wet, the sheep dip smell was back.  Finally got everything smelling , well, not of sheep dip. A definite improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then hunted up food, and more poison for the ticks.

&lt;p&gt;Ate lots and then headed out to Morven. Stopped and took a picture of the Kero Hut. Made from old tins, during the depression years. Lots of families lived in these type huts. Wouldn't happen today..&lt;/p&gt;

Lots of traffic, compared to what I have had. At Mitchell, I have a weekend to spend before getting to Roma. So I take the scenic route. Dirt roads with no traffic. Much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped Saturday afternoon just sort of the tar again. Went back up the road 5km to find a sheltered spot. Showers were forecast. Could happen,  might not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turned out it poured. All Sunday. My spot was sheltered, but the amount of water coming down, and the dry soil. Had mud running under the tent. Water also dripped in in a few places also. I don't think the Hubba Hubb Tent is a wet weather tent. More like a fine weather, with chance of rain tent. Used spare plastic I had to keep the sleeping gear off the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mondays ride into Roma was also very wet. Mud everywhere. Glad I went back up the road, the spots close to the tar were underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did spend Sunday cleaning up my bags. Found the usual amount of non essential stuff. Was happy to be able to reduce my load by a kilo. But since then picked up more stuff from the road supermarket. Currently carrying a whole roll of pink marking tape, and a full packed of giant cable ties. Both look useful, but I don't think I need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the time to find some water and wash the mud off my tent and ground sheets. Also washed my sandals and socks. The mud out here is very sticky. Clogged up the tires also. I took to carrying a stick to scrape it out. I would have washed in Roma, but I couldn't find a tap at all. Even getting drinking water was hard. Didn't like Roma much - too big, lots of mining traffic, everyone in high-viz gear. And traffic lights!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two locals in Surat went out of their way to come and tell me about the camping options and free showers in town. How sweet is that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cause I didn't use the showers - I'd washed in Charleville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went to look at the camping. It was a very nice site near the water. But, lots of caravans about. I've been spoilt: too much camping on my own. Loaded up with water and headed out. Found a lovely spot just for me later that day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>St George</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/09/2014-09-26-st-george/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-09-26T11:41:00+10:00</published><updated>2014-09-26T11:41:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-09-26:/posts/2014/09/2014-09-26-st-george/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arrived early, after a night of thunder, lightning, strong winds, and a little rain.

&lt;p&gt;Wandered in to Unique Egg, thinking to look about the sports gear, and found it was a tourist attraction on its own. 60 years of hand carved emu eggs. Spent time talking with Steve Margaritus about his life in Australia, and the eggs he'd carved. Was very interesting. Might go back and talk more with him another time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St George was smaller than I'd though it would be. I didn't stay long. Food then water, and headed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St George has the water systems: rain water, bore water and river water. Mostly people drink rain water, wash in bore water, and water the plants with river water. Yes, some off the taps give out river water. Noticeable from the muddy color.  I declined to buy bottle water, and eventually found a drink fountain near the river to fill up at. I suspect it is bore water, but had signs up saying it was drinkable. It is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd planned to take the dirt road to Dirranbandi, but after the rain, and locals saying it was probably all mud at this time, decided to stick on the tar. In the end it didn't matter. At the turnoff, the wind was blowing so strong, I decided to have an easy time, and not ride into a head wind. Stayed on the road towards Nindigully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stopped off just before the Nindigully Pub, and sheltered from the wind.

&lt;p&gt;Not sure if it was state rivalry or not, but was told I could only get water on the Qld side. Since I needed to go that way, I didn't argue.

&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, the park was busy. Lots of caravans, motor homes and campervans. Well a lot compared to how many I'd seen recently. I rode up, took my sandals off and walked into the pool. Figured my clothes needed a bit of a clean also. The water comes out of the bore warm, and with a salt content. I was hoping it was less than what was on my clothing. Only stayed in a bit, then out to dry off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temps have been trending upwards, so it didn't take long to dry. I interacted with a few of the visitors. Apart from one couple, parked noticeably away from everyone else, people were not happy. Grumpy would describe them. Not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was happy. Fine day, a wash, food, water. I didn't stay. While there was a lot of room, a spot on the first was already reserved for me.

&lt;p&gt;A Woolworths! So much food. The man setting up the garden section sees me and says where to lean my bike, and that he'll watch it. So helpful and friendly. I buy way to much, not having had breakfast yet..Never shop when hungry! A lesson I know, but ignore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Heading out of town, I unexpectedly encounter Saturn. I'd missed most of the solar system! It's childishly amusing to see that I'm heading towards Uranus. I won't see it though, as I'll be off on a dirt road before then. Uranus, the  seventh largest planet, the only one named from Greek mythology, rather than Roman. It's only been visited once in 1986 by Voyager 2, as it flew past on the way to Neptune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eating breakfast in Binnaway, I watch a magpie swooping the kids. It doesn't go for me. Maybe it spies the tanned, dried feet hanging off my bike, and suspects it could end up like that if it comes too close. Maybe it likes kids as they are smaller. Later it does take a few swoops at me, bouncing off my head. So much for that theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ignore the angry young man, who threatens to run me over. Though, I do wait until he has driven off north, then I continue heading south. My dirt road waits for me. Later I chat with a couple of farmers. Amongst other things, they tell me the turn onto a road I was planning to take doesn't exist any more. I'd been a bit iffy about that bit too, suspecting the GPS might not have the right info. But that's ok. It had been an enjoyable ride so far. With all the talk, the sun is sinking. After we part, I camp a few kilometers further on in some trees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;30km to Dunedoo, 10km to Mendooran. I go to Mendooran. The oldest town for something. But it's a dying town. Cafe closed and for sale, shop for sale, houses for sale. You guess that no one is buying. The helpful NRMA man doesn't know about the road my GPS is suggesting to Wellington. The area is a swamp, could be a fire trail there he says. He suggests an alternative that he knows exists. Off I go, but, another change of plan. Down a dirt road, and then into Dunedoo after all.&lt;/p&gt;

Lots of dirt roads; hills, sand, head scratching. GPS and paper maps didn't agree, and at times neither matched the roads. So did some exploring. Was all fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the angry young man from Binnaway, the young men I met were all very friendly. Guys driving somewhere - stopping to see if I'm okay, or needed anything. That is the way it normally is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Wellington, decided to go to Ponto Falls Reserve. GPS shows two routes. One on back roads over a large hill, the other along the highway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take the hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wrong!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could see the river in the distance. Met a farmer, and yeah, I'm on the wrong side. He showed me the river. Yep. 50m north is where I want to be. To get there is going to be another 40km - back to Wellington and then out on the other route. He lets me camp on his land. Though, just on dusk, after moving my tent twice, I moved out to the road side. His cows kept getting spooked seeing the tent and running around. I didn't think I'd sleep too well with that. Was worried they might walk over me.  But as it happened, I didn't sleep to well anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dark, all the irrigation pumps started. Fuel motors. Run all night until about 4am. Probably was louder near the river. I was about a kilometer away. Also during the night, I spiked my hand on something sharp under the tent- that wakes you up in a hurry. Can see the puncture marks this morning. Also have needle holes in the tent bathtub to fix sometime. Think it was just dry grass stalks, as didn't find anything spikey under the tent.&lt;/p&gt;

Even patches on patches. Until, I have to concede defeat. I try to salvage some of the fabric for patches, but usually it's not worth it. The combination of sun, sweat and dirt is the end of the cloth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lucky  I did then. Later in the day it clouded over and the temp dropped.. Been quiet nippy since then. Cloudy, showers, wind. Cold snap. Was 2C this morning when I woke, and I was on a hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that sort of weather, I lay about alot. Didn't do much. Watched the the traffic go past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it looks like chicken. It's small; not much bigger than a quail. Organic? No way. With all the farms here; pesticides and herbicides abound. Free range? Most definitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it looks like chicken. It's small; not much bigger than a quail. Organic? No way. With all the farms here; pesticides and herbicides abound. Free range? Most definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh. No broken bones. It was in good shape, so I plucked and gutted it.  A wash to get the blood out, and done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boiled, with veggies, lentils, fresh peas,  pasta and a touch of curry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My meat cooking is improving. This was very tender. Almost falling of the bone. Then it was a young bird, and I didn't cook it long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It gave a slight flavor to the pot, or maybe I imagined that. Not much meat. The breasts had the most, with the legs next. Though not even a mouthful all up. Lots of sucking on bones really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this worth it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing the carcass, knife and hands used 1.5 litres of water. The clean up of the cooking gear used more water than normal to get the oil/fat off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two plastic bags to keep it till I cooked it. Both have blood on them, so are now rubbish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it was a quail, it would have provided at most 200 calories. Most estimates are less and work on about 100 grams of meat after removing bones. I think I had less than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quarter cup of sultanas is 145 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tablespoon olive oil is 119 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tablespoon of peanut butter is around 100 calories (depends on brand, and how heaped the spoon:-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A medium apple is about 100 calories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's not providing major calories. Not major anything really as its to small to contribute much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing not a lot, the average person needs about 2000 calories a day.  Ten birds and it would make their basal calorie requirements. Exercise, and that increases. I pedal between four to six hours a day. I'd need a whole flock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it was showering here, I'd think no spraying recently, lowering the birds recent pesticide/herbicide intake. If there was a lot of spraying happening, it could have high levels if it was feeding in the sprayed areas. Impossible to know how much your eating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All up, for the time, effort, water and calories, there are better choices to be had.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Tanning hides</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/10/2014-10-17-tanning-hides/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-17T14:38:00+11:00</published><updated>2014-10-17T14:38:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-10-17:/posts/2014/10/2014-10-17-tanning-hides/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2014/20141016_105901-787778.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been havesting road kill for hides. I wanted to try out brain tanning. It has been an interesting exercise. While I've learnt a lot, I doubt I'll keep going. Why? In short, its a lot of work, a lot of gear I need to carry, I need to change my travel to fit in the processing, and I've no use for the hides anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find a fresh road kill, then string it up and start skinning. (People driving past slow down seeing me do this.) I then salt the hide so I can process it later. I need to make sure I have no cuts or scratches on my hands before I start. Afterwards I wash my hands with soap and water. The salted hide goes in a plastic bag. For a small wallaby I needed almost 1kg of salt. The water, is water I'm carrying for drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the hide daily and add more salt. Make sure the edges are done, and that the edges have not roll up and miss out on salt. Wash hands after touching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay somewhere with access to clean water. Flesh the hide. I did this with a knife and a piece of water pipe I found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rub in the tanning mixture. I tried eggs, but didn't like the the smell of working with them. So switched to soap and oil mix. Also easier for me to carry. Eggs kept breaking, or I'd eat them and not have enough to use on the hide. Work the mix into the hide. I'd spread the hide out and layer with oil, then rub in the soap with a bit of water. Eventually the hide goes white. While it is damp and until it is completely dry, keep pulling and stretching the hide. If it isn't completely dry, don't stop. If you do it will go hard. This will take a few hours. Any hard spots afterwards can be moistened and worked dry again. At the end of this - one tanned hide. Still needs smoking to finish it off, else if it gets wet, it will need all the stretching again to soften it. I've not smoked any yet. Places I've stopped have had no fire rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, I have to make sure I've no cuts or scratches on my hands. With setting up camp, taking it down, finding spot in the bush, I do get small scratches or nicks. When I do - no playing with hides. I could get gloves - but then another thing to carry, and more rubbish to carry afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to carry salt. At least 1kg of it. I'm currently carry 2kg to ensure enough. Salting is important, as it stops the hide rotting before its processed. Not enough salt, and it rots, or the hair starts to fall out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to use water for cleaning the hide, and washing my hands. This is water that I had planned on drinking - so have to watch how much I use, and get to somewhere with more water if I'm going to run out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrying the salted hide - its bulk and weight. Also need to not break the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleshing needs time. And no cuts, nicks on my hands, and water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tanning process is time consuming. I have to be camped somewhere with water for a couple days to finish it. It also needs to be reasonably fine weather. I could do it in showers, but its easier in fine weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of it I have a tanned hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a limit to the size hide I can do. Small wallabies, rabbits are about it. I think a large roo and I wouldn't have enough salt to salt the hide. I could flesh it immediately and dry it. But it would be awkward on the bicycle with a dried, stiff hide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What am I going to do with the hides when done? I don't know. One is not enought to make a pair of gloves - not that I need fur lined gloves. Would take a lot for clothing - but I like my current wear.  So I've no use for the end product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Been fun learning though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hide in the photo, I trimmed. Lost bits to damage when it was killed, and not salting the edges enough.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Gulgong</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/10/2014-10-19-gulgong/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-19T12:03:00+11:00</published><updated>2014-10-19T12:03:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-10-19:/posts/2014/10/2014-10-19-gulgong/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow.

&lt;p&gt;I've been hanging about in the area, but this morning decided to come into Gulgong to get more water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tip: If your GPS suggests Perseverence Lane as a route. Skip it. Lots of sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making my mind up to skip the road kill for now, this mornings ride in had dead everywhere; roo here, lizard there, bird on the side, snake off the edge (people really really go out of their way to run over snakes!), another bird, a second roo. So many dead animals. I rode past them all. Bought a jar of peanut buttter instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bit of indecision happening. Yesterday a tooth started aching. What to do. Weekend; so nothing open. Need to wait for Monday. But I could cycle somewhere before then. But where - Mudgee, Wellington, Dubbo, Sydney? Will wait till tomorrow and then decide. Today it feels a bit better. I tell myself this is good - pain decreasing means its going to heal up. Hahaha I can hope. It will need attention sometime. I'm getting a theory that exercise helps - why I cycled into Gulgong today, and will cycle back out again later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, the day is so gorgeous!

Then it pulled into the park. Someone got out and went into the toilet block. Music stayed on.  I could see the driver was still there, so, summoned up my courage and started walking over. As I did, he got out; six foot plus - I had to look up a long way past the tattoos various body and facial piercing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Errr, that music" I started to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arm started stretching out...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Noooo, No.. No.." I cried.  "Done turn it off!!! Do you know the band?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chatted for a bit. I was hopeless with knowing the TV shows the singers had appeared in. I found the a couple of the songs on Youtube.com:
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXKkNo8MFrs"&gt;Ol'55: On the prowl&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM-EjhBP-CM"&gt;Ol' 55 : Two Faces Have I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I rode out of town again to camp. Spent half of Monday trying to find a Dentist. Lots of calling, leaving messages on answering machines. A problem for me as I kept missing the call backs - being out of mobile reception when they called back. Played a fair bit phone tag. But then got lucky. Called a dentist in Wellington and spoke to a real person and booked an appointment for the next week, with the option of sooner if someone cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over a couple of days headed back towards Wellington, and then someone cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dentist was wonderful. I'd stayed in town one night at the caravan park so that I didn't need to leave my bike and gear out on the street. Needed to go back the next day. And again the dentist helped by fitting me in. Even got a spot to leave my bike inside while I was getting repaired so I didn't need to stay in the park another night. So teeth all fixed now. The dentist cycles, so he suggested a route to see a bit of the "
&lt;a href="http://www.animalsonbikes.com.au/tourist-map.html"&gt;Animals on Bikes&lt;/a&gt;
" art.&lt;/p&gt;

But with hills, a full load of water and a full belly of food and water, it was well past lunch and I was crawling along. After a short downhill into a dip and starting to pedal up out, I noticed a tapping sound in time with my pedalling. Don't remember that before. Bottom bracket? Pedal? Rack bolt? Was going to ignore it, but then thought I should have a look. Might just need a tighten, or worst case, need to think about order parts. Started poking about, but could find anything. Moved off, yep, still there. Hmmm.. Had a longer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrrrgghhh.. This is a problem!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chain stay had broken right through where it was joined to the rear drop out. Darn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was totally lost for a bit. The tapping was gap opening and closing.  Did some thinking. Decided not to keep riding. Needed to find a town and get repairs, or failing that, as I was not that far from Sydney, return there. Okay. Back to Wellington - were the XPT passes through and not that far from Dubbo, where might be able to find a welder.  Thought about going into a farm house and asking for help - some metal, drill a hole in it, bolt it threw the axle, and then hose clamps. But decided not to worry - just walk back for now. 70km.  Should take three days. That would work well - get there on Monday.  Okay. Start walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd only just pushed off walking when a lady I'd talked to back in the last small town stopped to ask how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Badly! Frame just broke."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turned out she lived near by and was on the way to pick up the kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up staying with them for the weekend. Helped out on the farm - got to work with sheep. Trying to herd them into pens was interesting.  I had thoughts about their brain power. But are they dumb, or smart enough to know what was going to happen?
&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8335465/Sheep-are-far-smarter-than-previously-thought.html"&gt;Sheep are far smarter than previously thought&lt;/a&gt;
The lambs were getting some treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, there was a scheduled power outage at their place. So rather than sit about in 38C heat, they dropped me in Orange and went shopping. Lovely family. Was fortunate to meet them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stayed at a caravan park, then Monday hunted the bike shops and engineering firms to see about a fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No joy with the bike shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineering shop. Grrrr.. Even less joy. Least the bike shop would say they couldn't help. The engineering/welding shop; I'd explained that its thin steel tube, the hub is important to me, and alignment of the drop outs very important. They have to be parallel. Rholoff hubs don't like being bent. But this didn't seem to be heard. I'd be told "its not that important, close enough will be fine."  Argh.. I'm paying and I don't want "close enough". It's an engineering shop! They make components to within ±0.001 mm. Why do people think it doesn't matter because its a bicycle? Why don't they listen to the customer? One guy started levering the chain stay up using a screw driver, levering off the hub shell. I stopped that in a hurry. Just what I needed, the shell to break - needing a wheel rebuild. Then he reached for a hammer. I left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to Sydney, stripped the frame down and gave it to a bike shop. But waiting for the quote now from a frame builder. I've been told it will not be quick - nothing less than a month, and price could be up to $600 to $700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for the real quote, as I find that upper limit estimate hard to believe, and said so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New frame is about $1000. Gone up, not down from when I bought mine. Mine is 3 years, 8 months old - out of warranty by 8 months. Not much point getting a steel frame if a break on a weld is going to cost a significant amount to repair.  A new frame - and if it breaks at the same spot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waiting for the real quote. But also thinking about getting a jig made up to check the alignment and then trying another engineering/welding firm. Set it up in the jig, and then tell them 'weld this up'. And then I confirm the alignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about options, and waiting for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go direct to Surly. BEFORE you get any work done locally!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not the sort of thing you'd expect to happen on a 3yo frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sure a lot of folk (me included) would be keen to hear how you get on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother's Troll just did the same thing.    His was under the 3 year warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saw the first comment, and thought why not. I emailed Surly. Got a reply almost instantly that I should not have this type of failure. They are in  contact with the bike shop now. I'll find out soon what the outcome is. I'll do a blog post as soon as I know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The frame is out of warranty. No work has happened yet, as was still getting quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to get on Facebook and see the comments. The page come up, and I read some, but now can't get back there, the link gives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This content is currently unavailable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The page you requested cannot be displayed right now. It may be temporarily unavailable, the link you clicked on may have expired, or you may not have permission to view this page."  Been that way all day now, and I can't find the group in search. Can you give me more information about the group so I can find it and join to comment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, sorry, but you were blocked from Facebook group: 'I love my Surly Ogre/Troll' because you don't have much/if any content.  Sorry, it's come to this, but there is so much spam that we look at profiles before adding users and if there's not much content or bicycle related content request are typically ignored or blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the trouble!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please send another request and you'll be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ah, that is why I couldn't see it any more. Yeah, had a fb account, but not used it in a long time. Even before that didn't post much, so I can understand how it might look like a spam account. Might have to do more with it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
Hi Guys,


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
I'm a fan of your bikes.
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/02/2011-02-05-surly-troll/" style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
Lusted after the 1x1 for years
&lt;/a&gt;
. Then I got a Troll. Just want I wanted; rack mounts, disk mounts, mudguard mounts, horizontal dropouts with Rohloff adaptor.


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
Its spent most of its life of touring in Australia, seeing lots of wonderful places. Many happy times we've had together, and I was expecting many more. But now, disaster has befallen.


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
Frame cracked at the weld on the rear dropout.
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/10/2014-10-30-orange-sydney-broken/" style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
http://www.wanderingtime.com/2014/10/orange-sydney-broken-surly-troll-frame.html
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
My
&lt;a href="http://www.cheekytransport.com.au/" style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
local bike shop
&lt;/a&gt;
, told me at 3 years, 8 months old, it's out of warranty. And so far estimates for repair are up to 3/4 the cost of a new frame, and at least a month, more likely several months wait.  They are getting quotes from frame builders.


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
My dilemma:


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
I thought steel would last a lifetime. If it did have an unfortunate problem - I was thinking "crash damage", it would be repairable - unlike aluminium frames. I haven't crashed my bike, I've just toured with it - loaded panniers, water and lots of bumpy roads.


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
I'd be shrugging off this break if it was more years down the road, thinking I'd had a long use from it.  But its had less than three years actual use, because one year was
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/pages/faq.html" style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
off the bike
&lt;/a&gt;
.  Though, in those years, it has probably travelled over 20,000km.


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
What is a reasonable lifespan for your frames?


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
People have suggested that my gear use isn't typical - everyday, loaded touring. Though, I can't see why it isn't. It is a frame made for touring. I do consider the terrain, and at
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/04/2012-04-10-perth-mundaring-to-j/" style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: none;"&gt;
times walk rather than ride
&lt;/a&gt;
as I want my gear (bike, racks, panniers etc) to last.  To date, I've not broken racks or mounting screws.  I think my use isn't unreasonable for your frames?


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
With the cost of the repair being not that far from the cost of a new - repairable isn't looking very cost effective. It was said that the chain stay might need to be replaced as a break there indicates a "chain stay problem". I'm at lost to understand why the whole chain stay would need replacing, but this no doubt this adds to the repair cost.


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
With the repair cost not that far from a new frame cost, would I be better to consider a new frame, especially if the current chain stays have a problem?  But then if my use is more than the frame supports, or more than can be expected from the frame,  wouldn't a new frame break as well?


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
I realise that sometimes stuff happens, nothing is 100%, and that this break may just be that; unfortunate, but uncommon. And that another Troll frame would never break, and that with a repair, this frame might never have another problem again.  But it has happened now, and to get travelling again I need to find a solution that I can have confidence in. I was fortunate that this break happened close to Sydney rather than the more remote corners of Australia I'd prefer to spend my time in.


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
Without my bike, I'm stranded. Wondering if to repair, or to buy new? If new, which frame - another Troll, and ECR, or? Is one going to last longer than the other?  Or if unfortunately, Surly frames are not suitable for my requirements, if I should be looking at another brand all together.


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;
Can you offer any help for this situation?


&lt;span style="background-color: #eeeeee;"&gt;

Thanks for contacting us about this unfortunate frame failure. Based on your type of use and what the troll is designed to do, you definitely should not have had this type of failure. I’m just glad you weren’t left high and dry in an even more remote area.
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;

Do you have a local Surly shop that I can work with on getting you taken care of? Also, what size frame do you ride?

&lt;/u&gt;

Hi Alexander,

Wow!!!  Thank you for getting back to me. And so fast too!

This is great news. Can't say how relieved I am that its just an unfortunate event and I've been unlucky and that I can stay with a Surly Troll.

had spoken to a frame builder on the phone when I dropped the frame off.  The pricing for repair was an estimate, frame unseen  - which was why I was waiting for the actual quotes to arrive.  Which was why I was wondering about what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So was waiting for Surly and Cheeky Transport to converse and let me know the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello Megan and Cheeky Monkey,
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;
I want to send a new frame your way but I have a story and a question…
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;
You see, long ago all of the Troll’s in the land held counsel under a bridge. While meeting and discussing many great Surly things they heard a clatter. Much to their surprise it was a dark and powerful prince on a quest to prove his worth. Now, everyone – even this dark prince – knows that you cannot simply cross a bridge with Trolls under it. You must first either do battle with the trolls or you must answer 3 of their riddles correctly. Now then, this prince was one of the strongest in the land and had won many battles in his day. His face was weathered and scarred from the battles he had fought. He was fearless. He was ruthless. He was destined to be king. Unlike many other princes before him, he was also very smart. He possessed a silver tongue that could weave the most intricate of webs in every single story he told. Point is, these Trolls had their work cut out for them on this day.
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;
Each Troll took their turn trying to stump the dark prince but one by one, they failed. He was simply too clever and too smart. Finally the bravest of all Trolls challenged the dark prince to a battle. This troll, Orange in color, was thought to be one of the most ruthless fighters among all of his Troll brethren. Surely he would not be bested in combat by the dark prince.
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;
As the sun began to set in the Western sky, the battle for the bridge commenced. Through the dark of night they fought. Exchanging blows in a driving, stinging rain until morning came. At sunrise, it was clear to see the scope of their battle. The landscape around both man and beast was decimated. The other Troll’s looked on in horror as both fighters continued to relentlessly attack each other.
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;
This epic struggle carried on for 3 more days and nights. At the end of the 4
&lt;sup&gt;
th
&lt;/sup&gt;
night, both man and beast, exhausted from battle declared that there could be no victor. Both were simply too strong and too determined to be defeated.
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;
Proud to have finally met an adversary worthy of such a battle, greed began to set in. You see, an idea is sometimes the most dangerous weapon of all. This idea of theirs would drive them to the ends of the world. They vowed to travel together seeking all the power and riches of the world. They would never sleep, never eat, and they will never stop their relentless campaign of pain and intolerance. Once enemies, these two warriors now embark together to claim what is theirs….
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;
And that’s where the last 16” Orange Troll disappeared to.
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #1f497d; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;"&gt;
So, I will gladly send you another troll frameset but, it would have to be wither black or eggplant (see below). Please let me know which you would prefer and we’ll get one sent out to you.
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;
&lt;u&gt;
&lt;/u&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How awesome is that! I'm getting a new frame!  And I loved the story.  When I stopped jumping up and down, punching the air in excitement, rather than just a quick, simple reply of thanks, gratitude and colour choice, I thought to get into the spirit  and write a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello Alexander,


My joy knows no bounds.


After reading your story, I'm saddened to hear that the race of 16" Orange Trolls is no more.


Mine was born like all others. Through the seasons, it grew experienced and wise. Questing across the vast lands of Oz, over hill and dale, the vast planes of the outback, through weather fair and foul. It has been a faithful and loyal companion. Its absence leaves an empty place by my side. Sorely will it be missed.


While my heart grieves that that colour is no more, a Black Troll has been elected in its stead. Together, we will sallying forth, adding new deeds to the wandering chronicles.


Thank you so much!!! I'm so happy!


&lt;span style="color: #888888;"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #888888;"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #888888;"&gt;

Megan


ps. maybe its just my eyes or the screen (or both), but the two pictures look the same colour to me. Even on your website, I don't see any difference in black or eggplant colour options.  I have seen eggplant in store - at Cheeky Monkey though.


&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will miss my Orange Troll. While I wasn't that keen on the colour originally (then, I wanted black). Over time, it grew on me. I got to like it, and given the choice would have it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I'm one very happy Surly owner this morning. Excellent service from Surly. I never expected that they would replace my frame. How can you say "thank you" enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd like to thank the Anonymous poster who suggested contacting Surly. Without that prompt, I probably wouldn't have done it, and still be sitting here thinking about what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also thanks to the crowd on Facebook in the "I love my Surly Ogre/Troll" group.  I did get to see the link after the admins of the group helped. Because my Facebook account didn't have much on it, and most of that was private, spam filtering tagged me, and I was blocked. All fixed now. I might try and use Facebook a bit more now after the help from people.  Just have to figure out how to use it with my travel, power budget and Internet plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On trying to get the frame repaired. Several people had said to just press the weld back into the break and get it welded. No need for a frame builder, or to fuss with alignment.  The reason against this is that I run a Rohloff Hub. (Rohloff also have fantastic service btw). I had an annoyance once with it leaking oil out the drive side seal. Yeah, it can run without oil no problem. But I liked to keep it inside the hub and had time to get it looked at.
&lt;a href="http://quantumbicycles.com/"&gt;Quantum Bicycles&lt;/a&gt;
are an authorised repair agent by Rohloff.  They put in a lot of time and effort into trying to find why my hub was leaking. New seals leaked within a week. In discussions with Rohloff Germany, the German engineers suggestions included checking frame/drop-out alignment.  Rohloff hubs don't like being twisted. They do not have a solid axle through the centre. With the drop-outs not aligned, bolting up each side applied a twist to the hub. Only a tiny amount, but enough to affect the wear pattern of a part inside the hub and then the seals. It took time for this to occur - I'd ridden 1000's of kilometres by then. Rohloff replaced the internal part and seals for me - they didn't have too, as the cause of it was the drop-out alignment. With straight drop-outs, no leaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With where the break occurred on the frame, I didn't want to risk the drop-outs not being aligned and leave me with a problem down the road, all for not checking the alignment at repair time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case your wondering, like I was, about a Rohloff weight limit.  I wrote to them asking about limits, and this is a bit of the reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"&gt;
the SPEEDHUB has&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="il" style="background: rgb(255, 255, 204); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"&gt;
limits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"&gt;
as to the primary transmission ratio that is used. This is to make sure that the input torque to the hub is not too high and therefore damaging. There is no actual system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="il" style="background: rgb(255, 255, 204); color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"&gt;
weight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"&gt;

limit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;"&gt;
as such, but if you require a lower gear ratio to get the large mass in motion, then this may not be permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surly and Rohloff, both excellent customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can't really say enough about how grateful I am to
&lt;a href="http://surlybikes.com/"&gt;Surly&lt;/a&gt;
stepping in with this offer of a new frame.  A huge weight off my mind about what to do. Can look forward to getting a new frame, and getting back on the road again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Surly.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice of Surly. I work at a bike shop that sells Surly. I had an Orange Troll too, sold it to my brother in law. My son and I both ride Cross Checks now. Great bikes. I did see another Troll with a broken frame recently, though the guy is VERY heavy. Still steel frames should last a lifetime unless accident or corrosion happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then, I like ants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a couple of other interesting sculptures.  But of the remainder, some wouldn't have been out of place in a playground. And some, you would have walked over them if they weren't fenced off with a little plaque telling you it was a sculpture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left thinking that overall, it was less than average. That this year, Sculpture by the Sea was relying more on the location for impressive than the sculptures.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Mourning over: new Surly Troll arrives</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2014/11/2014-11-20-mourning-over-new-su/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-20T16:23:00+11:00</published><updated>2014-11-20T16:23:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2014-11-20:/posts/2014/11/2014-11-20-mourning-over-new-su/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wow!

Cheeky Transport &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt; for http://www.cheekytransport.com.au&lt;/sup&gt;
opens at 10:00.  I didn't want to be late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time slows when your waiting. But of course, it does pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Maisey holding the recently deceased, Donny holding the just born.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick check and drool, then Donny got to work. Faced off the headset and bottom shell and cleaned the threads. Didn't fit the bottom bracket yet, but did fit the head set cups. Also did a quick check of the rear drop-outs for alignment; they are perfect. Then it was off to get some supplies before that first feed.  Lots of time to admire the paint, welds, braze-ons and stickers. Lots more braze-ons now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been a warm day, just right for what I had planned:
&lt;a href="http://surlybikes.com/info_hole/spew/spew_care_and_feeding_of_your_steel_frame"&gt;Care and feeding of your new frame&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She's now sitting in the kitchen on newspaper, oozing. Luckily I'm here alone, else I've a feeling we'd both be out in the garden shed. Feeding was messy. We both got covered. I won't need to moisturise tonight.
&lt;a href="http://www.whiteknightpaints.com.au/specialty-paints/metal/rust-guard/prep/fish-oil"&gt;White Knight Rust Guard Fish Oil&lt;/a&gt;
isn't as fishy as it could be, but its not completely odourless.  Maybe when it dries a bit more.  Just need to shoo the neighbourhood cats away until then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of rust preventative products about. But, think of this: fish swim in the sea all day, and they don't rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, sheep don't rust either, but the hardware didn't have Lanolin, so fish oil it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's gone 36C here today, so so maybe she will be dry by morning for assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day of rest, then back out. William weighed my gear, 40kg back wheel, 24kg front wheel, and me. "Too heavy" was said. He was to wise not to comment on my weight, but did say he weighed less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I influenced him though. He took his heavy bike for the ride out with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not enough low gears though. He struggled to stay behind me on the hills. Had to rush to the top and rest till I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After William turned to return home, I continued to Molong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The road to Gumble looked quiet, so off I went. And soon had problems. Flat tire. I couldn't figure out how, as it was a long cut in the direction of the tube, on the inside. Patched it. Got 10km, patch it again. New glue this time. Stopped for the night near Gumble. A locality now with only the community hall left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning all started good. Till another deflation. I changed the tube, and changed course to return to Orange. No other bike shops for a long time, so better to get a spare tubes now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new tube lasted 20km. This time I was sure it was the rim tape. Added duct tape over the top, and got another 15km before flat again. Never had I so much trouble with rim tape, tubes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last 30km into Orange was slow. Walk up hills, pumping the tube up, roll down. Repeat. It felt good when I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bought new cloth rim tape, spare tubes, glue and patches. Hopefully it's all sorted now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn't impose on William again, so a night in the van park before I head out again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weird thing leaving Orange; had a squeak. I thought it was the bags rubbing the plastic tubing on the rack. Eventually I decided to do something about it, and found to my horror that the rack was loose. Not just mildly loose, but really really loose. All the bolts holding it on. And the bolts on one side of the front rack. I checked everything then. Only the rack bolts, and only the one size Allen key. Someone playing a prank I think. They would have needed more than an Allen key to remove my racks. Only could have been the last night in Orange, as when I used the Troll during the day all was fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll check squeaks sooner next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumut, nothing special. Food, water, then off towards Batlow. Given where I'm headed, there is a lot of up hill, without much down. Seem to be spending more time walking than pedaling. Narrow roads, lots of traffic. 4x4, logging trucks, semi trailers.  I bail off to have a rest under a tree. The day drifts into afternoon, then evening. I stay, watching the trees, clouds and butterflies. One night, two nights. Third night, kids turn up (again!) at midnight! Sleeping I don't hear them arrive, but yelling, car doors slamming, and music wake me. In the dark, they don't see me. I sit and listen to them. Lots of swearing; every second word. Is this how they talk all the time? After an hour, they leave and I fall back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

It's larger than I was expecting. I'm ravenous, eat my breakfast, quarter of a watermelon, a loaf of fruit bread and a handful of cashew nuts. Still I'm hungry, but decide to leave. Better to be a bit hungry than stuffed full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tail wind leaving, and it is good, until it moves to a cross wind, and strengthens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm walking. The wind is roaring. Black clouds grow. I head down a narrow dirt track to get to a parallel road. But riding is impossible. Even walking is difficult. Just as rain drops hit, I find a bush to hide behind. There are other trees about, but none I trust to shelter under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch the storm pass. Not enough rain to wet me. But the wind continues. Eventually I decide to find better shelter. More walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An hour later, I find it. A stand of Casuarina trees. I wait in vain for the wind to drop. Dust clouds are whipped up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watch the fire brigade speed past, and look anxiously for a fire. Impossible to tell with the dust. No smell of smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As darkness falls, I'm not going anywhere. Still too windy.  A couple hours later it eases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next morning, in Walbundarie, I learn the fire was at Rand. But it's out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rand, when I arrive it's a ghost town. Or maybe aliens have abducted everyone. I stop for lunch. Then riding around the town, still see no one. Slightly spooky. I head off towards Urana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I see a ute driving up and down in a paddock. Is this what country people do instead of driving round and round the block? Nope, Jay is doing EM Mapping. Up and back, 30 meters apart, for the whole field, dragging the sensor. He tells me of fields that are 8km in length. Long uneventful days, just driving up and back. I guess it is a job that drones will replace in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Urana, Boree Creek, Narrandera</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/01/2015-01-02-urana-boree-creek-na/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-02T15:11:00+11:00</published><updated>2015-01-02T15:11:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-01-02:/posts/2015/01/2015-01-02-urana-boree-creek-na/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It was quiet when I rode into Urana.

&lt;p&gt;I headed out towards Boree Creek and found a camp. Very quiet; only saw one car pass by.  Needless to say, my NYE was very peaceful. The weather was dry, with no wind. I left the fly off the tent, and went to bed early. Woke a few times to watch the stars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ride into Boree Creek had me wondering if I was on a road, or just going through a farmers paddock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://time4tour.com/"&gt;Tim the Tourist&lt;/a&gt;
in Boree Creek before going to Narrandera We first met up Far North Queensland last year. Kept in touch on email. First time I've met another traveller in two states. Hung out, ate too much, drank too much, did some chores, and had an enjoyable time. Also avoided riding in the 42C days. Ended up staying longer than I'd planned as the temps stayed high. But eventually, it was time to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was glad to get away from the caravan park. Had the idea the owners hate having people there. Bins not emptied, lights not working, taps leaking, coin BBQ swallowed coins, and failed to start, toilets without paper, toilet block locked. And the constant, 24x7 elevator music. Arrrgggh. Not one I'd stop at again, even though it was near the lake and town swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding; start early in the day while it's cooler (25c), stop by lunch time when it really heats up (38c). Sweat lots in the heat and humidity. Batten down for the passing storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pass through small dying towns each day. The buildings closed. Weathered and fading signs showing the business that once existed there.  The servo is going as well. No people needed. Replaced with a credit card browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had a moment walking into a shop yesterday. Something has happened somewhere and the morning tv show was in full overblown emotion showing. The serious, shocked, outraged looks on the presenters. The shop staff clustered around the tv, not to miss anything. TV flashes to photos of men with beards and headwear.  That is when I walked in, still covered up, to order a burger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need to keep track of the days better. Tullibigeal. Nothing is open on the weekend. And today I just found out is Saturday..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: Not true. I was to early for a weekend. The Tullicafe opens everyday. They make a great burger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quiet day after that, listening to the rain on the zinc roof under a picnic shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It showers, drizzles or rains during the night. When I wake, it continues. I fail to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find out the locals have all been talking about the poor woman in her tent at the picnic shelter. When the fourth person comes over to offer somewhere out of the wind and rain, I give in. More to ease their worries than from concern about the wind and rain. I move to another larger shelter, out of sight. It's also more peaceful, people wise. Empty sheds nearby, roofing iron clangs in the wind makes a memorable night.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Tullibigeal</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/01/2015-01-13-tullibigeal/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-13T05:59:00+11:00</published><updated>2015-01-13T05:59:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-01-13:/posts/2015/01/2015-01-13-tullibigeal/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Claws on cement.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, on to the next town. I had to be in Sydney by the weekend, so needed to pedal more. But..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia has a few fences. The
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo_Fence"&gt;Dog Fence&lt;/a&gt;
, and the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit-proof_fence"&gt;Rabbit Proof Fence&lt;/a&gt;
. Where they cross roads, there is a gate. Australia has a slang term "
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan"&gt;Bogan&lt;/a&gt;
".  So, when I saw the town
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan_Gate"&gt;Bogan Gate&lt;/a&gt;
on the map. I had to go there. Sadly it was disappointing. No fence. No Gate. No sign. No Bogans. Nothing. I met other travellers later who were just as disappointed. There is a small town there, but no one about when I stopped. Thought there would be something to cash in on the tourist appeal of the name.  From the Wikipedia entry, the residents in places with the word "Bogan" in their name have lobbied to have a name change. They don't want to be associated with Bogans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was nothing to do, but ride on in the showers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Forbes, Eugowra, Cudal, Orange, Lithgow, Sydney</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/01/2015-01-20-forbes-eugowra-cudal/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-20T08:39:00+11:00</published><updated>2015-01-20T08:39:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-01-20:/posts/2015/01/2015-01-20-forbes-eugowra-cudal/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It would have been better to have skipped Bogan Gate, but least Forbes was downhill.

Eugowra, then back onto dirt to get to Cudal. Found another road that the GPS offers as a route, but isn't there. It was a pleasant 15km hill climbing detour to sort that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stayed in Orange the one night, then set off to Bathurst early the next morning. Arrived in Bathurst early - sat around reading, eating, sleeping. It had gotten very windy so I wasn't keen on moving, but then at 3pm, the wind dropped a bit, and changed direction. Now it was a tail wind. Hah. Can't sit still for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finished the day with
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com.au/maps/dir/Orange+NSW/Lake+Wallace,+Wallerawang,+New+South+Wales/@-33.3667154,148.9995367,9z/am=t/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b102cd0e28c4861:0x50609b4904423f0!2m2!1d149.1012702!2d-33.2835775!1m5!1m1!1s0x6b0df636db7a9991:0x2a0609b4d1de62e0!2m2!1d150.0794347!2d-33.4160193!3e1"&gt;120km&lt;/a&gt;
on my legs.  Wasn't an enjoyable road. Lots of traffic, minimal or no shoulder in places. The drivers that pass without much clearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could have gone into Lithgow, but stopped at Lake Wallace,
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallerawang"&gt;Wallerawang&lt;/a&gt;
to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I arrived late - just on dark, so rushed to set-up camp. There was a bit of a crowd - back packers, campervans, etc. Not a place I like to stay, but it was late. Wanted to check it out for friends that had asked about staying there. Only one night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrible. Terrible. Not sure which group it was, but they drank, yelled, argued till the early hours of the morning. Young sounding, I suspected the backpackers, but it could have been locals partying. The grounds are close to Lithgow and housing areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithgow Tourist Information had told me in the past that camping is allowed there. What they didn't say is that the toilets are locked overnight.  I've dealt with this in the past - bottles and bags, carry it out. Not a problem.  Others dealt with it by using the ground.  In the morning there was used toilet paper blowing about, and fresh faeces scattered about. Icky! Icky! Seeing the gardens in the light - this was not a once off affair. The gardeners there must be saving on fertilizer costs. Feeling dirty angry, and disgusted, I packed and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stopped to complain at the Tourist Information Centre. They said that it had nothing to do with them, wasn't their problem, and nothing they could do.  They still direct people to stay there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday. Trains.  Track work :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could change trains five times, and take almost six hours to get to my destination.  Wasn't going to do it. Change at stations without ramps or lifts - lots of carrying bike up and down stairs. Sunday, there would be no staff about. Finding the right platform and train to catch would be an added challenge. I decided to wait till Monday - two trains, three and a half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caught the 4:16 train out of Lithgow. Not many people on it at that time. But it filled to standing room only as it progressed down the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now back in Sydney for a visit before heading north. Will be a here on and off for a few weeks. Friends with holidays wanting to go cycling and camping. So I'll be out of town a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney short trips; How do you like apples?</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/02/2015-02-04-sydney-short-trips-h/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-04T19:09:00+11:00</published><updated>2015-02-04T19:09:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-02-04:/posts/2015/02/2015-02-04-sydney-short-trips-h/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Been in and out of Sydney the past couple weeks going away weekends with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first trip on the Australia Day long weekend, I was challenged to take just my two small panniers - which are really the large Ortlieb panniers. It was hard to trim down to that level.  I'm so used to having everything with me. Had to really think about what to leave behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trip was a bit of a wash out. The plan was to spend two nights out. The campsites would be dry, so needed to carry water.  The camps were up high, not quiet on the top of the ridges, but close.  The first night we just got the tents set up before the storm rolled in.  We were not short of water. Wind, rain and lightning. Some of the strikes were so close. With more storms forecast, and high winds on the way, no one wanted to stay another night. Next day was heading back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was lighter pedalling with less gear. But I missed my usual gear. I missed knowing where in my panniers everything was. I found it slightly frustrating having to pack those two small bags so carefully to fit everything in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend,  I was back to four panniers. I did leave a few things behind. Still caused me problems. This time the panniers were too empty! But found a solution to this on the last day. Apples! The trees were all fruiting this year. Couldn't go past without sampling them. Would have been criminal to leave them behind, so we filled our panniers. Since I had the largest panniers... When we got back I weight the apples I carried - almost 20kg!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan was four nights out. Food was shared with a plan of who brought along what. We made up for the washout the week before. The first day was easy as it was mostly downhill, with water, and a luxurious hot shower at the end. After this it was a lot harder, uphill, dirt roads, and carrying water. There were no more showers. More interesting was the food planning; not enough calories for continual days of six hours hard pedalling. We were good for the first two days, but after that, we were all started suffering. But we did have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also ate a lot of apples.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney, a longer trip in the Blue Mountains</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/03/2015-03-12-sydney-a-longer-trip/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-03-12T08:04:00+11:00</published><updated>2015-03-12T08:04:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-03-12:/posts/2015/03/2015-03-12-sydney-a-longer-trip/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just back from another trip about the Blue Mountains.

Just minutes before it departed Central, he was telling us we shouldn't be on the train and threatening to get the Police onto us for not obeying him. All his talk and threats of police came to nothing in the end, but was a worrying and unsettling trip and completely unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, blue skies, lots of road side fruit trees, and some very lazy days. Back to Hill End for a visit, then over to Hargraves, Mudgee, Rylstone, Glen Alice and Glen Davis before returning to Lithgow for a non stressful trip back down again.  In contrast to the trip up, the guard on this trip was very friendly and helpful.  Biggest day riding was just shy of 100km - Hargraves to Rylstone with a tail wind. Shortest day was just 12 km.  So lots of lazing about, reading was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managed to return with only 10 kg of apples this time. Made a special detour to go back to our favourite tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the day through Sofalia up to Hill End which was very hot, we had a 5C overnight in Rylstone.  Sadly my home made chain guard, that handled 42C last year, didn't survive. The cold night cause it to warp badly. Not sure if the heat really did the damage, and the cold finished it off, or it didn't like the cold, but after a day of hoping it would straighten out, I had to pull it off and bin it. Running without a chain guard for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a chain guard, I'll have to pay the chain a bit more attention. Lube is good, but commercial stuff is expensive. I like the dry wax lubes - like White Lightning or Rock n Roll. Decided to have a go with a homemade formula. I dissolved candle wax in some Shellite that I use for my stove. The Shellite evaporates, leaving the wax on the chain. It doesn't last long though - flaking off too fast. I get about 50km before it sounds dry. Going to add in some beeswax to the mix, which should have more "stick" to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another casualty, was my ebook reader, a Sony PRS-T1. Fortunately it lasted until I was back in Sydney, before half the screen faded out. It has been a faithful companion for many years. With Sony no longer making them, I'll get one of the Kobo ereaders. Reading is essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will be about Sydney a few more weeks yet, before heading north. The cyclones up there are making the place very wet. Also heard there are swarms of mossies about. I can wait.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Detoxing naturally</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/03/2015-03-23-detoxing-naturally/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-03-23T13:29:00+11:00</published><updated>2015-03-23T13:29:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-03-23:/posts/2015/03/2015-03-23-detoxing-naturally/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The weekend is over and I'm feeling shiny!

Yep, had a honest and authentic detox happening Sunday. Out with all those toxins and pollutants. And today I'm feeling fantastic! The difference is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mine was not one of those wimpy celebrity detoxes.  No days of just drinking juices. No lists of allowed foods or forbidden items. No special meal plans. No costly books. No special shakes. It didn't cost a cent. And, no willpower required at all! During my detox, food was the last thing I was thinking of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, there's more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lost a bit of weight. A modest amount, not just the water, but definitely fat. The detox process included a full body workout. True, it was tough and tiring working out. Every muscle is exercised, even the ones I didn't know I had. But the result speak for themselves. All that sweating like a pig; you could just smell the toxins oozing out, and feel the calories burning up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll admit, that there were times when all I wanted was a long hot shower and some sleep. But with no hot water on tap, it wasn't to be. Boiling a litre at a time wasn't going to cut it.  And I thought my usual cold wash might be a bit too bracing under the circumstances. Can only cleanse so much at once. Be nice to your body. Best not to over do it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had my choices, I'd have run the detox during the day, rather than starting after sun down Saturday night. But once started, there was no stopping it. You just have to keep going till you're out the other side. Expelling toxins takes some effort. This detox needed a full 24 hours to run its course, though only the first 12 hours were really full on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arh, the joys of it all. Nothing like a 2am rushed stagger to the pit to know your still alive. When your colon's going eight rounds against the duodenum, it's such a relief when they both pass out. Keep up the supply of fluids though. It might feel like its just flowing straight through, but really, its cleaning. Flushing out the toxins and pollutants. If you've ever tried cleaning up a dirt spot with just paper, you know you need water.  Hot is better if you have it, but any clean water will do in a pinch. And don't be shy with it. Drink plenty. Add a bit of salt, and sugar to the water. With all the cleansing happening, you'll need some salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sun up Sunday morning, the bulk of it was in the past. The rest of the day was catching up on sleep, and some gentle eating - plain boiled brown rice and sweet potato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I'm not sure what triggered my detox.  But I'm not going to worry about that. It shows that my body is working at peak efficiency. It knows when to start detoxing.  No effort from me required at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got access to a stove, so rather than making  my usual flat bread, I decided to bake bun. Haven't done this since was on the Great Central Road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, while doing this, I read the self raising wholemeal flour ingredient list: "Wheat flour, Coarse Bran, Acidity Regulators (339,341,450,500)".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not that keen on the acidity regulators now that I look them up, but  'Coarse bran'? Why is there coarse bran in wholemeal flour?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had perhaps, naively, assumed that "wholemeal" meant what the
&lt;a href="http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/wholemeal"&gt;dictionary&lt;/a&gt;
said it did "...made from the entire wheat kernel... " .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, no. Foolish assumption!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunting about led me to
&lt;a href="http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2014C01190"&gt;Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code - Standard 2.1.1 - Cereals and Cereal Products&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracting out bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"flours or meals means the products of grinding or milling of cereals, legumes or other seeds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"wholegrain means the intact grain or the dehulled, ground, milled, cracked or flaked grain where the constituents – endosperm, germ and bran – are present in such proportions that represent the typical ratio of those fractions occurring in the whole cereal, and includes wholemeal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"wholemeal means the product containing all the milled constituents of the grain in such proportions that it represents the typical ratio of those fractions occurring in the whole cereal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the typical ratio of endosperm, germ and bran?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking about, found on
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_flour"&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;
that  "Wheat consists of approximately 83% endosperm, 14.5% bran, and 2.5% germ by mass."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over on
&lt;a href="http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/consumer/labelling/ingredients/Pages/default.aspx"&gt;Australian Food Standards&lt;/a&gt;
website, they state "Ingredients must be listed in descending order (by ingoing weight)."  Seems to me that the flour isn't wholemeal as per the standard as it is missing the 'germ'.  Since it has '
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_flour"&gt;wheat flour&lt;/a&gt;
' as the first ingredient, and bran as the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at
&lt;a href="http://www.glnc.org.au/grains/grains-and-nutrition/wholegrains/"&gt;Grains and Legumes Nutrition Council&lt;/a&gt;
picture of the parts, and the section "Identifying Whole Grains" it says "When checking to see if a food contains whole grain ingredients look for these words in the ingredient list:"  and then, shows that "wheat flour" is not a wholegrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks to me like false marketing - calling the flour "Wholemeal flour" when it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note, nothing says they have to add in the same part of that grain back in. So, start with the grain, remove the germ, and bran,  and then mill the endosperm. Ship the three parts to different factories. Each factory adds in their own stock of missing parts, maybe from overseas sources, and then calls it 'wholegrain'. And that is ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot find a definition of "coarse bran".  Looking about the supermarket, the one other "Wholemeal" flour I found had the ingredients as "Wholemeal wheat flour" - which is more like what I wanted - having all the parts of the grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You cannot trust any words written on the front of a packet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home made yoghurt. Made with powdered milk. I'm onto the second batch now, this only lasted two days before being eaten.  Kept well, considering no fridge - kept it in the shade during the day after making it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making it was easy. Mix up the milk, add some vanilla, then boil it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important step. Not only does it sterilize the milk, but
&lt;a href="http://www.medicinalfoodnews.com/vol01/issue5/kalab.htm"&gt;some reading&lt;/a&gt;
says that the heat changes the protein, to help it 'set' later (if all goes well). Other people say it
&lt;a href="http://www.nwedible.com/do-you-need-to-heat-milk-for-yogurt-making/"&gt;doesn't matter&lt;/a&gt;
that much for commercial milk. Not sure how much heat is applied to powdered milk, but I need to boil anyway to sterilize the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait till it cools to blood temperature, then add in two tablespoons of
&lt;a href="http://www.jalna.com.au/"&gt;Jalna Low Fat&lt;/a&gt;
yoghurt, and mix it well. Then keep it warm for 6-8 hours. I wrapped it up spare clothes.  Made it in the morning, and found it set the next morning when I checked.  It may have set by the afternoon - but I didn't check.  Keep two spoons to make the next batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Jalna low fat yoghurt as that is what I had. I like
&lt;a href="http://www.jalna.com.au/"&gt;Jalna&lt;/a&gt;
yoghurt; Australian and simple. No thickeners, gelling agents, nothing artificial, no colours, no preservatives, no stabilisers or emulsifiers. But any natural yoghurt would work to provide the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll try making yoghurt when travelling - will be a bit more messy as the best time for the temperature will be during the day. But then it will shake about on the bike. Probably will not 'set' in that case. But hopefully will still be 'yoghurt'. Thinking a bag might be better - then can force the air out and it will not splash about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also have a two batches of sauerkraut fermenting. Ideally they should stay a few weeks before being done. But since I'm leaving soon, I'll eat one later this week. Might try the other in a bag on the bike also..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has been keeping me here is my dental problems persist. Frustratingly, I didn't have any problems when I went for a visit for a "clean and check". But that found that some fillings needed replacement. After having fillings replaced, a tooth started aching. It has then dragged out. Maybe just irritated from the filling. Sounds like the root is dying. Root canal needed. Maybe not needed. Lets wait to see if it gets worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll keep my fingers crossed that the ache goes away, or at the least, don't get any worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I take the non direct route to Barraba. It takes a few days. The mining has expanded and the road has been closed permanently. I flag down a mining vehicle, and am told there is an alternative path around the closure. But the driver wasn't sure. The maps I have haven't been updated and provide no help. With no signs to guide me, I return to another route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I pass the Rangari automatic telephone exchange. Would have been the heights of modernisation once..&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Bingara, Warialda, North Star</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/05/2015-05-15-bingara-warialda-nor/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-15T11:09:00+10:00</published><updated>2015-05-15T11:09:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-05-15:/posts/2015/05/2015-05-15-bingara-warialda-nor/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;My sleeping bag needs more feathers in it!

&lt;p&gt;But after the sun has comes up, it's all forgotten; beautiful sunny, warm days. Who could want for more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've managed done dirt roads along the way. The old farmer that stopped told me I was lost. I wanted to believe I wasn't. I had suspected it was going to get interesting when the road became two wheel tracks. But as it as heading the right way, all seemed all good. Later I had to back track and return to the tar. Not bad, a 60km trek about the farm roads. Would have been only 20 km if I'd stayed on the tar.

&lt;p&gt;A quick run through Goondiwindi for shopping. Then on northwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving Goondiwindi, I managed to miss the turn off, maybe it was enjoying the tailwind. I've been along the road too many times, something wasn't right. Stopped, checked the map. Yep, missed the turn off. Bit later, I was sure I was on the right road;  narrow, no shoulder, lots of truck traffic and roadside rubbish. Yep, going the right way now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
of that. I've never been interested in the rugby.  Even without knowing the rules, there was something about the players; their lack of necks, the 'sniff each others armpits' gatherings, running forward but throwing the ball backwards! And they always throw themselves at the ground. What is with that?  The players can't think at all; get ball, run straight forward to smack into another player, all fall down. Get up, and repeat. Like blowies
&lt;a href="#4" name="top4"&gt;

always comes to mind: "Their eyes were dull, their heads were flat, they had no brains at all;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mate explained, there is Rugby League and Rugby Union. And when looking into the history, it all becomes clear.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union"&gt;Rugby Union&lt;/a&gt;
started about 1845 at
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_School"&gt;Ruby School&lt;/a&gt;
, the oldest, most expensive boys school in England.  Soccer, also called football, was the game played before that. A game where only the goalkeeper can touch the ball with their hands. What happened was, one of the rich boys, not able to kick the ball, picked it up and ran. Maybe he'd also heard about the new game played out in Australia, but didn't know the rules. He couldn't kick a ball to save himself. Not being too bright, he ran straight into another player, and they all fell over.  His father, who gave big bikkies
&lt;a href="#5" name="top5"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
5
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
to the school, said his son was right, that was the way to play football. The school, not wanting to get in a blue
&lt;a href="#6" name="top6"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
6
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
with the father, and risk losing all the moolah
&lt;a href="#7" name="top7"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
7
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
he gave to the school,  gave into to him and agreed.  After that, everyone was told to play the new game. Thats what happened,  Fair dinkum
&lt;a href="#8" name="top8"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
8
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league"&gt;Rugby League&lt;/a&gt;
formed in 1895 when some clubs split from the rest over an argument about players pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where as,
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_Australian_rules_football"&gt;Aussie Rules&lt;/a&gt;
had its beginnings in the early 1820's in Melbourne. With
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club"&gt;Melbourne Football club&lt;/a&gt;
being the oldest in the world that is now professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So would you rather support an English game, created by rich school boys that can't kick a football, or a true blue
&lt;a href="#9" name="top9"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
9
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
Aussie game? No question there; Aussie Rules!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the State of Origin games; Aussie Rules had been playing
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_matches_in_Australian_rules_football"&gt;interstate competitions&lt;/a&gt;
were played from 1879.   Rugby games were played from 1908, but wasn't really known about till a couple of journalists, wanting to sell more papers, got the rules changed in 1980. It worked, so that is how it stayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the advertising for the State of Origin, Aussie Rules has
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures#Top_10_leagues_in_average_attendance"&gt;higher average attendances&lt;/a&gt;
, and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sports_attendance_figures#Top_leagues_in_recent_domestic_club_championship_event_attendance"&gt;highest Grand final attendances&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, what could I do; he's a mate, so I went to the pub to watch the first game of 2015 series. In the lead up to the game starting, watching one of the Queensland players beating his chest; it reminded me of a nature documentary I'd seen on gorillas.  Needless to say, the game was shit house
&lt;a href="#10" name="top10"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
10
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
. Finally, Queensland, who hit their heads slightly less than the New South Wales side, fumbled the ball, accidentally kicked a field goal and went on to win by the one point. Amazing. Kicking is not something rugby players can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the better game; Aussie Rules. Watch the
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BAaCBC1V1Q"&gt;big men fly&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="#11" name="top11"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
11
&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
.  They can run, kick, jump, and have necks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team: St Kilda.  Go the Saints!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I was able to watch St Kilda Vs Melbourne (STK Saints V Melb Demons) Round 11. A great game! Here's the last 2 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor old Granddad's passed away, cut off in his prime,&lt;br&gt;
He never had a day off crook - gone before his time,&lt;br&gt;
We found him in the dunny, collapsed there on the seat,&lt;br&gt;
A startled look upon his face, his trousers around his feet,&lt;br&gt;
The doctor said his heart was good - fit as any trout,&lt;br&gt;
The Constable he had his say, 'foul play' was not ruled out.&lt;br&gt;
There were theories at the inquest of snakebite without trace,&lt;br&gt;
Of redbacks quietly creeping and death from outer space,&lt;br&gt;
No-one had a clue at all - the judge was in some doubt,&lt;br&gt;
When Dad was called to have his say as to how it came about,&lt;br&gt;
'I reckon I can clear it up,' said Dad with trembling breath,&lt;br&gt;
'You see it's quite a story - but it could explain his death.'&lt;br&gt;
'This here exploration mob had been looking at our soil,&lt;br&gt;
And they reckoned that our farm was just the place for oil,&lt;br&gt;
So they came and put a bore down and said they'd make some trials,&lt;br&gt;
They drilled a hole as deep as hell, they said about three miles.&lt;br&gt;
Well, they never found a trace of oil and off they went, post haste,&lt;br&gt;
And I couldn't see a hole like that go to flamin' waste,&lt;br&gt;
So I moved the dunny over it - real smart move I thought,&lt;br&gt;
I'd never have to dig again - I'd never be 'caught short'.&lt;br&gt;
The day I moved the dunny, it looked a proper sight,&lt;br&gt;
But I didn't dream poor Granddad would pass away that night,&lt;br&gt;
Now I reckon what has happened - poor Granddad didn't know,&lt;br&gt;
The dunny was re-located when that night he had to go.&lt;br&gt;
And you'll probably be wondering how poor Granddad did his dash--&lt;br&gt;
Well, he always used to hold his breath&lt;br&gt;
Until he heard the splash!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not caught up on all my posts yet.  And I'm getting ready to shoot through.  Just been just off playing tourist for a bit in the past week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then onto &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillagoe,_Queensland"&gt;Chillagoe&lt;/a&gt; for a walk about the rocks and ruins.  And a surprise catch up with
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-03-uluru-ayers-rock/"&gt;
Stuart and Thomas
&lt;/a&gt;
of baking fame back in 2012 on the Great Central Road. They were travelling with Robet. Bit of a shock for Thomas, yacking away in the beer garden of the pub, talking all about me when I walked in, sat down and heckled him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not surprising he didn't recognise me out of my cycle gear. He'd only ever seen me like
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2012/08/2012-08-19-my-first-damper/" &gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.  Impossible to know if I had hair, let alone style and colour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stayed an extra day, eating delicious bacon and egg burgers made by Andy at the Chillagoe General Store and catching up. We had planned to meet and cycle up north together, but I couldn't wait for them, and arrived about when they set off from Charleville. Was hoping to still meet up with them and had emailed, but not heard back. Not surprising as reception being iffy out that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before finally getting to the reason for the trip; a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campdrafting"&gt;
camp draft
&lt;/a&gt;
near
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimbulah,_Queensland"&gt;
Dimbulah
&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20150726_145653.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20150726_145653.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separate out the cow from the pack and keep it up near the gate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20150726_150335.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20150726_150335.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then chase it around the paddock.  Okay. Was a bit more to it than that. The cows conspired to frustrate the novices. The experienced riders made it look easy. Mostly. Sometimes the cow seemed to know that the exit was at the other side of the paddock, and made a beeline straight out the gate.  One didn't want to play at all, and jump clean over the fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of cowboy hats and boots, horses and cows. All well sprinkled with fine brown dust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian Slang:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Struth&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;exclamation of surprise.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Shoot through&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;leave, usually to avoid or escape from someone or something.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Yacking&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;non stop talking.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Megan,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really enjoyed this post. The links scattered throughout were all interesting, especially the link to Chillagoe. I always look forward to your blog. Best wishes from Perth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, 5 hours later, I'm back where I started in Cardwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before rode over a hill to see two cyclists on the road! Wow.. Need to catch them. And I did for a bit. But I think they didn't like my music, and soon pulled away.

&lt;p&gt;Well, 5 hours later, I'm back where I started in Cardwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day before rode over a hill to see two cyclists on the road! Wow.. Need to catch them. And I did for a bit. But I think they didn't like my music, and soon pulled away. We met up again and spent the night at a caravan park in Cardwell. They are riding for
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/breakthecycle2015?fref=ts"&gt;Break the cycle campaign 2015&lt;/a&gt;
.  Great stuff. We talked long into the night. Was really glad that we'd chanced to meet up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rode out next morning, but my destination was Long Pocket. Will and Safi were off to Ingham.  Unfortunately the "road" to Long Pocket closed in 1881, and is now a very rocky walking track. Never letting that stop me, I spent an hour pushing up hill before admitting defeat having covered less than 1km. Running out of water also, and pretty stuffed, battered and brused, I returned to Cardwell for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The
&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldQrapQ4d0Y"&gt;lyrics from the Toby Keith song&lt;/a&gt;
were running in my head;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;'Now my body says, "You can't do this boy"
But my pride says, "Oh, yes you can
I ain't as good as I once was
Thats just the cold hard truth'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it wasn't a wise decision to have tried that. Now I'm bruised and sore. And will have to take it easy for a while to recover.  I've also reconsidered my plan to head to Charters Towers by a similar route, that would have involved much much more climbing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Cardwell</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/08/2015-08-06-cardwell/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-08-06T16:58:00+10:00</published><updated>2015-08-06T16:58:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-08-06:/posts/2015/08/2015-08-06-cardwell/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20150806_105625-734703.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been slow to leave Cardwell. Bruises on my legs needed time to heal. The calmness and scenery have also played their part..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A monument to turtles of the past, while their smaller offspring are harvested in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turtle harvesting commenced on the beach. Once they were large, big enough for two men to pick up and carry away. Now they are a lot smaller, and it's faster to harvest them with machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Megan, what is turtle harvesting? Are they adult or juvenile? And are they being harvested for food? This disturbs me a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belyando Crossing was interesting. They wouldn't give me any water, or sell me any except the fridge bottles at $4.80/1.5L. I'd used about 20L getting there. 32C days, head winds. So was going to be expensive buying water. They said the river water wasn't drinkable.  But it was used in the kitchen. Also the ice was river water at $4.40/3.5kg. It would seem that it had to be safe to drink! If you stayed the night there was taps in the laundry. I got lucky and got water from a passing motor home.

&lt;p&gt;Do most of my riding early in the day to avoid the heat and wind. Then shelter up for the day amongst the trees.  I've had the plan to move on in the afternoon, but it hasn't happened. Averaging about 40-50km a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally my parcel arrived, and I was off. Hot, humid days, with lots of small flies. Hard to laze about a camp in those conditions, so 120km days became the norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Megan, you could probably use one of those portable charging packs to charge your phone in an emergency. Might be a little extra weight, but at least you can charge your phone when there's no electricity available or using the bike's dynamo is not an option. They're not expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have a battery pack I could have used, but I was anticipating wet weather, so wanted to save it for that. Can't charge anything in the rain. My dynamo charger is waterproof, but plugs aren't.&lt;/p&gt;

Stop for breakfast early, in the shade. Cycle. Snack. Drink. Cycle. Enter a town. Buy food if needed, fill up with water, cycle out. Look for the perfect sleep spot; the Hilton 5 star spot - an easy wheel off the road to get to, flat ground, no road noise, no animal trails, no high grass, soft leafy ground cover, no thorns, secluded, shade, no tall trees that could drop branches, no dead trees that could fall over, water near by, bushes to block high winds, but still allow a cool breeze off the water, no flies, mosquitoes, ants, ticks, or spiders. Get tired and settle on a "good enough" - none of those, but will be shady when the sun goes down in another few hours. Decide which is better: hotter sitting in the tent in the sun out of the flies, or standing in some partial shade and wave the flies away. Stand and wave the flies away. Eventually the sun sinks enough that the tent is in the shade, climb in, chase the flies out and eat a cold dinner in peace. Sun sets, stretch the leg muscles, sleep, to wake up and do it all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few variations: I stopped in Barraba for a day to visit friends and wash. Managed a 150km day after that, mainly because the planned stop had no shade at all, it was still early in the day and Wallabadah was &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; 70km away - how hard could it be? Six hours later, I could answer that. But all I remember now is how great it felt to get there. It was one of the rare days when I carried minimal water, because the towns are close, so I had to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rear tire was a bit soft a couple of days. Add air to fix. It got worse. Finally got tired of just added air each time, so checked it out. The rusty nail was a suspicious. Pulled it out and yep, that's the air leak. Fixing it took less time than all the time I'd spend putting air in.  Leave the wheel on the bike, pop the tire off the rim, pull the tube out, patch, push it back in the tire, reset the tire, add air. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scone - decided not to stay between the main road and the coal train line. So caught the train down to Sydney. Surprisingly with night trackwork, and busses replacing trains, the bus driver let me on the bus. Might had been because at 11pm there was not a lot of people wanting to get on - four of us on that bus. Back on the train again, and got off in Hornsby to start riding. Halfway to my sleep spot it started raining. I pondered how all the way down from Cairns with one brief thunderstorm overnight and I get rained on now 30 minutes from stopping. In bed at 2am slightly damp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now in Sydney again and surprisingly cold! Had two warmer days, but I'm in thermals/jumper most of the time. Feels like a Chinese curse - may you get what you wish for. I wanted cooler, I got it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney: Time for a change</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/11/2015-11-23-sydney-time-for-a-ch/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-23T07:31:00+11:00</published><updated>2015-11-23T07:31:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-11-23:/posts/2015/11/2015-11-23-sydney-time-for-a-ch/</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;  &lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/20151029_092253.jpg" &gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the recent cycling I was doing a lot of thinking. I'm going to try a change; and not cycle to Cairns next year to see family. I'll travel there some other way- bus, train, or plane. I've cycled the route enough times now that the trip is becoming a drudge. Especially the section between Clermont and Charters Towers. It's worse when I leave it too late to head south and it's hot. Also, I want to go some places I can't take the bike.  A fair amount of my gear needs replacing at the moment. Since I need to replace stuff, the plan is to lighten and shrink up my gear load to fit in a backpack. I'd like to try walking for a bit. It will take a while to do this, as I haven't walked much in years. Why walk when I can cycle? The most I have walked is inside Woolies or Coles shopping; my walking muscles have wasted away. I need to build them up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day I do some walking exercise. At first my feet, ankles and calves ached terribly. I needed days of rest to recover. But it's improving. Soon as I can travel a reasonable distance repeatedly, I'll start adding weight to my pack. Then it will be short trips to check how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightening the load will have benefits even if I end up not walking.  My current bike gear weight is over 30kg and it all "seems essential". Even after taking out the bicycle specific items, what's left is heavier than I want to backpack. My aim is to get the weight down to less than 15kg, preferably less than 10kg.  That is the base weight:  the pack and everything in it, except food, water and fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously some hard choices will have to be made to achieve that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>We're all going on a summer holiday..</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2015/12/2015-12-13-were-all-going-on-a-/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-13T15:39:00+11:00</published><updated>2015-12-13T15:39:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2015-12-13:/posts/2015/12/2015-12-13-were-all-going-on-a-/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2015/IMG_20151203_181516612-745355.jpg" &gt;

Not just one less, not a temporarily separation but getting back together later, but really none. My beloved Surly Troll, that has been with me on many adventures is gone. It has moved out to a good home. It's going to settling down with a partner of similar attributes. They'll have Sunday rides, raise some kids and go on family adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Just a memory now.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, my paring back is continuing. The tent has been re-seam sealed and is ready to move on. Down sleeping bag went to Vinnies, as will some of my excess clothing. Personal Locator Beacon, deregistered and sold. The Whisperlite International stove and Ortlieb Panniers are off having new adventures. I dare say the stove is seeing a lot more daily use than I ever gave it. After maybe one meal a day, it's probably quite shocked to be doing breakfast, lunch and dinner, with morning and afternoon coffee. A solar panel, water filter, and bunch of other stuff, that a day later I couldn't remember exactly what, and so showed how important it was, is off to another friend. Some other things, worn, but not quite worn out yet, or oh so joyfully discovered in rubbish heaps, or on the side of the road; I've hardened my heart, and placed in the bin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, in between bouts of procrastination, progress is going really well. I can see the end in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a friend mentioned that I had a bunch of papers at her place.  Twas quite a surprise to me; I'd completely forgotten the old filing cabinet contents from years ago. Given into safe keeping, but perhaps it was more "I really want to get cycling now, and don't want to deal with this - can you hold it. I'll be back for it soon." Six and a half years later, I'm dealing with it. The folders where chockablock
&lt;sup&gt;
1
&lt;/sup&gt;
. Thankfully with the passage of time, most of it can easily be binned; decade old receipts; from which I learn't that things cost a lot less than today, airline tickets and boarding passes, hotel brochures and old photos of parties, in which I was very happy and very cheerful with lots of people whom I haven't a clue who they are now. Stuff that seemed terribly important at the time and needed to be kept, now quickly moves to the trash.  Some papers are more troubling; the "official records". Some I bin. High school and university semester results, certificates of attainment and old tax and banking records. But others, while I wanted to bin them, confident that in this day and age, no one requires paper, the reality isn't so simple. True, some institutions have moved with the times, and will accept electronic copies. But perplexingly, others really do want that piece of paper that looks like it come out of an 80's dot matrix printer with a blurry and fading stamp on it. And if you don't have
_ their _
piece of paper, you're in for a lot of time, hassle and expense to get a new one, or come up with an alternative. I wonder if a new one would still look the same? Still considering if this really needs to be kept. Or if, at this time of my life, that I'm not likely to need it any more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to stop with just physical stuff downsizing, I'm also culling and organising my digital world. The free storage offers, have just encouraged keeping files, purely for the sake of keeping. Like the cupboards in the house, that you hide stuff away in to not think about, so it goes online. But I'm onto it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music files got deleted. The tracks that were so truly awful that you can't bear to even hear them; they went years ago, but others that aren't that bad, but by the same measure, aren't that good either. Been holding on to them as 'they might grow on you'. Deleted them. If they haven't grown on me by now, they're not going to in the future. Without them, I they will not have the chance to grow on me, so that solves that. Can't miss what you don't have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ebook collection lost hundreds of titles by the simple measure of 'might I read this?'. For a surprising amount of books - no. I've been guilty of hoarding
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=free%20books"&gt;free books&lt;/a&gt;
, or falling for the "collection sale on now" tactics. You know, where you buy 10 books for less than the price of one, to get that one book you might, perhaps one day, if you've nothing else, maybe like to read, and nine others that are absolute rubbish, that no one wanted and they never sold. So bundling them in as a collection is the only way to move them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos fortunately wasn't a much of a cull - I already have a small collection there. I still recognise all the people. Better keep them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so it continues. Still trawling through the records digitised when I started on the road. Like the filing cabinet folders, there is sure to be plenty in there to bin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's something satisfying about cleaning up, having less. A sense of achievement. Nothing lurking in the corners, or hidden way, forgotten or undealt with. Knowing exactly what you own.  A feeling of freedom.  Go on, give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian Slang&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;66cm (26 inch) Tourex Mens Bike&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 18 speeds to choose from, this bicycle is fantastic for you or your teenager. Great for simply getting from A to B or incorporating into your fitness regimen for cardiovascular exercise. Featuring a sturdy steel frame, Shimano derailleur, front and rear V brakes and a quick release seat position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suitable for ages 14+ years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Features: 18 speeds, Shimano derailleur, steel frame, front and rear V brakes, quick release seat position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minimum height: 157cm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheel size: 66cm (26 inch)
&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I liked the colour - blue. It edged out the ladies bike that was cream coloured. Also, I thought the top tube might be marginally stronger than the lower height step through frame on the ladies bike. For my intended use, any advantage on the strength is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basket was an $12 impulse buy. Handy to put stuff in. I think that along with mudguards, front baskets are an underrated and overlooked accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bike was bought sealed in its box. I assembled it enough in the shopping centre to wheel it back here to finish assembly. This gave me the chance to check that nothing was damaged or missing while I was still close to K-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this time, some people will be screaming - buy a real bike! Its junk, a clunker!  Certainly the online forums are full of such advice, or suggesting getting a second hand bike. But there are some voices of reason amongst them. A cheap bike has its place, if you know what you're getting involved with and can work on it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new rider, there are a lot of advantages to dealing with your local bike shop:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you get expert advice to find a bike that fits you and suits what you want to use if for.  K-Mart bike there is no advice from anyone in the store. What is written on the box is all there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fitting options.  K-Mart bike is one size only. Unless you can find an assembled bike on display, you have no information about if this bike is a good fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fully assembled and correctly adjusted bike. K-Mart bike is in a box and you do it yourself. For a novice, this can cause problems with incorrect adjustments and fitting, leading to unhappy cycling or injury or death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the bike will be suitable for its use. K-Mart bike can't be taken off road even though it looks like a MTB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;swapping out of parts is possible. K-Mart bikes you get what is in the box no options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;usually a free first service. K-Mart has no bicycle service offers at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a knowledgeable professional will always be there to offer help, advice, complete servicing and repairs. K-Mart bike - your on your own, and given the low price of the bike, bicycle shops will be reluctant to help as the low quality components have limited adjustment ability and the cost of any work and parts will quickly exceed the cost of the bike.  It may not seem like it, but they are doing you a favour by not working on your cheap low quality bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you get a longer period before gear wears out. K-Mart bike has very low quality components.  Cheap low quality metal, plastic and poor quality seals and bearings, mean a short lifespan before requiring attention.
But still, a cheap bike has its place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My criteria had: MTB like, new, cheap.  The K-Mart bike met all those and it edged out its nearest competitor the Target bike, by being $50 cheaper.  There could be good deals to be had on the second hand market. I had a quick browse of the offerings, but wondered about proof of ownership.  Are you really going to check who owns a sub $100 bike? Is that sub $100 good deal, really owned by the seller, or are you just aiding the bike theft market?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then thinking about the need to factor in travel to inspect, passing it up as too damaged, repairs needed on an acceptable bike, I decided it was going to be hard to beat $99 new for ease of owning, and certainty with what you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you get is a very cheap, very low quality bike. It's not to be denied, it has some short comings.
Nothing on K-Mart says the bike is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_bike"&gt;MTB&lt;/a&gt;. It just looks like one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are warned not to take it off road, or try stunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160127_130056344.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160127_130056344.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure why not to ride at night. Maybe because it doesn't come with lights. I did read the owners manual and was surprised to learn that the frame has a 5 year warranty! How many high end frames have that sort of warranty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of components isn't great. The fork boots come with manufactured in sag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;  
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160127_130323850.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160127_130323850.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The rubber boot does not grip the fork slider at all.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just to catch and add dirt and grit to wear these bushings out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;  
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160127_130343009.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160127_130343009.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Nice soft plastic bushes. Reckon they'll last?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the moment the forks kind of slide, and no slack is detectable there. I don't expect that to last long. To put that off a bit longer, I used cable ties around the rubber boots to keep them against the fork sliders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheels are fairly true. The rear could do with a bit of a touch up but will leave it till I've clocked some kilometres and do it then. Tires are nylon and rated for maximum of 90kg. I'm expecting this to be the first upgrade that will happen. No maximum bike load is listed in the owners manual, so these  will be the limiting factor. Being just nylon, they will suffer easy punctures compared to the Schwalbe Marathon Tour Plus tires I'm used to. Gear changing isn't lightning fast, nor slick. Slow and steady is the go here.  Brakes adjusted, do the job of stopping. Pedals turn, chain to rear cluster. All the normal bike stuff. I've still to check how much grease is on the bearings. I've seen multiple online reports of 'not much', so probably is worth looking into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike weighs in (with basket) at about 16kg. Not too bad considering the lump of metal that is the front suspension forks, the side stand and the steel frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the low quality gear, the first ride brought out the cycling smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What next? I need to find some bits to build a rack.  The aim is to keep the bike low cost, so a Tubus rack is out. I want the rack to mount my backpack on - so it has to be a custom creation. I'll go scavenging for materials.
Bike lock. My last lock was Abus Granit 1000 Steel O Flex Cable Lock. A hefty 1.55kg. But at $100, its more than cost of the bike. I was going to get a $15 K-Mart combination lock. But quick research shows that is easy to
&lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5929247/crack-a-combination-bike-lock-in-under-30-seconds"&gt;
break the combination
&lt;/a&gt;
. The K-Mart U-Locks have the barrel keys. They fail with a
&lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2004/09/twist-a-pen-open-a-lock/"&gt;
Bic pen attack
&lt;/a&gt;
. I remember when Kryptonite replaced all their locks when that attack came out.  So need to find something else. The trade off between lock cost and bicycle cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mudguards. Will find some core-flute to make a set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedals are plastic. I'll increase the platform size for foot comfort, since I'll not be wearing the Shimano sandals.
Mount mirror on handle bars. I found a small make-up mirror on the side of the road. Just need to make up a bracket to hold it in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tires/Tubes. Undecided still on thornproof tubes or Tuffy liner or just wait and swap them for better tires.  Schwelbe tires front and back will be worth more than the bike but could be a useful upgrade. Who likes patching punctures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then,  load it up with my gear and head bush again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why I'd get this bike?  A few reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a bike that I don't have to worry about. I want to do walking, but most of the places are not easy to get to. So will need to ride out to them and then leave the bike there while I'm off walking. It could be days before I return. I never got over leaving the Troll out of my sight. It always seemed "wrong" leaving several thousand dollars of bike locked to a bush or a street post, and then wander off and leaving it.  I couldn't do it and this affected my travels; by not going places where I had to leave the bike, or by being overly worried about it when it was out of sight. It should have been easier when I was off in places with hardly any people, but I never managed it.  The Troll was never a bike I could walk away from. I was too attached to the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also affected catching the train or bus. Too many bits that I didn't want broken or bent on the Troll because of the cost, inconvenience of repairing them, so was super cautious to the point of not travelling on trains or buses to avoid the worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, heading north, I'll not cycle all the way up. So there will be some bus or train or plane travel. With the K-Mart bike, it's not a worry.  Depending what happens, it might be better to leave the K-Mart bike somewhere and collect it on the way back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the sense of worry for me has been the lowering cost, and increasing power of battery powered angle grinders. For less than $100 you can buy one at Bunnings now. No lock is safe from an angle grinder. And it is faster if the thief is after just the parts.  The frame isn't hardened steel like a lock.
So a lot of angst about the Troll because of its high quality and costly components. None of that with a $99 K-Mart bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a high end bike does buff the ego a bit, and it does feel nice to ride - no denying that.  But is it that much better to ride?  I spent a lot of time walking with the Troll. I'll do the same with the K-Mart bike. No difference doing that.
The very cheap bicycle isn't for everyone. You will certainly need some bike maintenance skills to keep the K-Mart bike on the road. It would not be cost effective to have your local bike shop build or repair this bike. But I think that within its limits it can be a great buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping a friend with a guttering job. Picked up a ladder, guttering and other bits from the hardware. Wasn't the fastest trip, but easier than carrying it by hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I raised the seat, so the load is flat. Tied it down firmly onto the seat, and closer handlebar. The far side was looped around the grip, but not tied. I could pull on the rope across the load to hold the load on, and to turn the bars to steer around corners. If it had been tied down firmly, no turning would be possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent two days to complete the guttering job. Mainly because the afternoon thunder and lightning storm interrupted us just after lunch on day one. By the second afternoon storms it was all done, and we could sit back and admire our effort and bask in the feeling of a job well done. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Barefeet?

And it doesn't hold up so well.  A lot of websites
&lt;a href="http://www.bywayofbicycle.com/toe-clips-vs-clipless/"&gt;parrot the line&lt;/a&gt;
, but hard science for the claim is not so easy to find. I found
&lt;a href="http://bicycles.stackexchange.com/questions/14059/are-there-any-scientific-studies-proving-the-benefits-of-clipless-pedal-systems"&gt;other riders&lt;/a&gt;
also having trouble finding any evidence.  The studies I have come across like this:
&lt;a href="https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2008-1038374"&gt;Effects of Pedal Type and Pull-Up Action during Cycling&lt;/a&gt;
(
&lt;a href="http://www.radlabor.de/fileadmin/PDF/PowerForce/Mornieux___Stapelfeldt_Artikel_Feedback_Pedalkraefte_2008.pdf"&gt;full paper&lt;/a&gt;
), concluded it didn't matter what pedals you have. Also interesting was that another claim of clipless pedals - that you can pull upwards and get more power; well, it reduced efficiency.  The study looked at submaximal cycling - so not flat out as hard as you could go, which I think is valid, as apart from track or sprinting, that is how we mostly get around. There could be advantages in those situations, but that wasn't examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A site that was interesting had
&lt;a href="http://teamboriscycling.com/styled-13/styled/styled-7/index.html"&gt;The Flat Pedal Revolution Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;
. It also covered another couple of points that I'm still researching: the pedal under the ball of the foot pedal position and rigid cycling shoes.  Still researching this, but it is looking like that a better position is midfoot or at least behind the ball of the foot, and that the shoes are only rigid because if you use a cleat for the clipless pedal, you need something for that to clip to. The small size hurts your foot, so the rigid sole was solution. Which these days gets spread as "you need stiff soles to ride a bike".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, with all of this going on and riding the Kmart Bike, I've been finding the pedals uncomfortable on my thin soled shoes. Been experimenting a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;  
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160207_124914768.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160207_124914768.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;You need mudguards.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Had rubber matting wrapped around the pedals for a day, then foam pads, but found both of them uncomfortable from the spikes on the edge of the pedal. I ground the spikes off, but the hard edges of the pedal were still uncomfortable.  A bit of flooring, and I've a nice big comfortable platform now. It might be a tad too long, but it is comfortable to stand on. I'll try it a longer before shortening it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other activity on the Huffymobile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rack:  My original plan was to make a rack myself out of wood. But the attachment near the axle wasn't going to work on the derailleur side, so I was thinking of another option. Hunting ideas, an ebay rack seemed a quick solution - an acceptable weight limit, cost and delivery time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now an unhappy $33 ebay purchase. False advertising. It was advertised as having a 25kg max load weight, but arrived with a sticker warning of a 9kg max weight limit. To rub salt into that wound, the sticker is visible in the photos, but not readable. Still in dispute with the seller over this. While very quick to respond to the sale, they are now glacial at answering any messages. I'd have to pay the return cost, and they won't refund until they receive it back. So I'm thinking the most likely outcome is that I'll keep it, look at ways to strengthen it, and give them a bad review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mudguards: A quick build as it was raining. Used corflute. Very wide at the moment, but I'll wait till the rack is sorted out before trimming them down. Also would like to find some stainless steel for the struts, as the wire coat hangers will rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bike lock: I wanted a cable. All the research on this come to the same conclusion. Cable locks are no better than string.
&lt;a href="http://www.bicycling.com/bikes-gear/reviews/smash-lab-bike-locks-broken"&gt;Too easy to cut&lt;/a&gt;
with easy to carry pocket tools. A D-Lock provides
&lt;a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/05/the-best-bike-lock-and-how-to-use-it-according-to-bike-thieves/"&gt;better security&lt;/a&gt;
. Problem for me is that a D-Lock is often not big enough to go around a post. So I bought a OnGuard D-Lock with a cable.  If I can lock the back wheel and frame to a post - great, I then use the cable around the front wheel for something to do with it.  If I can't, I still lock the back wheel and the frame together, and use the cable around the post. The front wheel is not quick release, so it stays without a lock.  I very much doubt a thief is going to go to the effort to cut the cable, carry off a Kmart bike and then still have to cut the D-Lock off to ride the bike. Lock so far is the single most expensive item after the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front forks: The rubber boot with cable ties didn't work. The fork actually does slide sometimes, and the boot would stick at its top point, or the cable tie would slip off. So I've wrapped the whole area from the top of the fork to below the rubber boot with plastic.  Held on with cable ties and duct tape. This will do better at keeping the dust out. Might accelerate rusting though. Time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought to remove the spring and replace it with a piece of pipe to make the forks rigid, but don't have an extension tool long enough to reach the bolt to disassemble the forks. So that will have to wait. Another option is to put hose clamps on around the sliders. But will wait on this for when the bushes start showing play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other:  Gear changing is crunchy and uncertain at times. Some of this is expected new cable stretching, part of it is me, not used to derailers after years of hub gears. I do miss the fast, easy, change gears when stopped. This catches me out and especially on hills. Need to keep up enough speed to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brakes: The front brakes squeal. The brake arms are thin pressed steel plate and the attachment to the fork has some play. The fork even with the fork brace, flexes easily. Cleaning the rim, the pads, adjusting toe in, helps. I have silence for a day, but then slowly the squeal returns. One side pad and rim is wearing as I'd expect. The other side, the pad and rim are not. The pad seems to melt, and polish the rim, leaving a gummy residue. Clean ups and sandpapering the pad and the rim so far have been temporary solutions.  I'll keep persisting with it, for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seat:  The saddle is 165mm wide. I prefer narrower. On shorter time in the saddle, it hasn't been a problem. With longer time, the seat started to be uncomfortable. For the time being I'll adjust the front/back position, but longer term - it might need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've known people that have lost their seat. Why some would take a seat I don't know. Vandalism?
&lt;a href="http://www.citylab.com/navigator/2015/06/how-to-not-get-your-bike-seat-stolen/396554/"&gt;Seat theft happens&lt;/a&gt;
.  No matter how expensive the bike, a seat loss would be hassle. The Kmart bike for some crazy reason, had one quick release clamp: the seatpost clamp.  I like slow release; so used a bolt and nut to replace it. The rack also clamps to the seatpost, but is bolted on the frame - so more of a deterrent.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Still in Sydney</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2016/03/2016-03-03-still-in-sydney/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-03-03T18:16:00+11:00</published><updated>2016-03-03T18:16:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2016-03-03:/posts/2016/03/2016-03-03-still-in-sydney/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Still about in Sydney.

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some stuff on the bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pedals: The wooden pedals from last update didn't last long at all. Not only did they destroy the plastic pedals underneath, they kept getting in the way when pushing the bike. I like the idea, but it needs some more work.  Currently have a salvaged set of VP-559 flat pedals that work really well with my minimal footwear. They'll probably not last long as the bearings are on the way out. But until then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seat: Luckily I've gotten used to the saddle now. It can stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rack: The ebay seller, gave me a 50% refund. Was okay with that. But notice, they (and other sellers) still have the rack advertised with 25kg (or more!) weight limit. Guess not many buyers complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brakes:  Scavenged some better brake arms. And all is silent now. So happy with that. The original brake arms were just pressed steel plate - 2D. The new ones are cast - 3D. They also fit better on the brake posts - a lot less movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I'm up against the next limit on better braking; the plastic brake body on the handlebars. Its problem is that it bends. The lever is aluminium, but the body that it attaches to is plastic. Pull the lever, the brakes press on the rim, pull harder, and the body bends towards the handlebars. So there is a limit to how much pressure you can apply. But it will be okay. Just need to keep the brakes well adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tires: Decided to get Schwalbe Marathon Tour Plus again. The rear tire is smooth already, after about 500km. I've had one puncture, and that is just going to get worse as time goes on. Decided I don't like mending punctures at all, so, going back to tires that I know and love.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney: Changes &amp; Maintenance</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2016/04/2016-04-09-sydney-changes-maint/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-09T10:30:00+10:00</published><updated>2016-04-09T10:30:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2016-04-09:/posts/2016/04/2016-04-09-sydney-changes-maint/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It might seem that I'm still doing nothing, but I have been out of Sydney for a camp.

The main purpose was to test all my new gear out. It went reasonably well. As expected, there were some issues, and the trip was ultimately cut short due to dental problems. But it was enough time to be comfortable with some of my changes, and convince me that other things needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principally I carried too much gear with me again. Part of this was as I was testing various items. Part of it was my old problem; just carrying way too much that is really not needed. Still working on this.  More in a later post on my new gear set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the trip, the Kmart Bike needed some work. Logged about 600km on it so far. Rear tire was bald by this time. I could probably get a few hundred kilometres more out of it, but the puncture rate would increase. No way would I get to Cairns on it. I doubt that it would make it to Tamworth. So far it hadn't punctured, but it was only a matter of time. The front tire holed as the rim tape had moved, or was never over the spoke nipples to start with. When I removed the rear wheel, the rim tape was twisted and not covering the spoke nipples that well either. So was only going to be a matter of time before that tube punctured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes: Replaced the 9kg weight limited rack with a 25kg one found in a council clean up. A lucky find. Still in its packet, but missing the small mounting hardware. This rack is lighter and stronger than the ebay rack I purchased.  Changed the rim tape on both tires to Zefal cloth tape, changed both tires to Schwalbe Marathon Tour Plus.  Tires are consumables. But it still amuses me that each tire is almost the cost of the bike.  Added a Mirrcyle MTB Mirror as the previous one was just too dark to see well out of, and vibrated too much to be useful. Bar ends found in a garage sale for $2 completed the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintenance: The bottom bracket was a bit loose, so I pulled it out for a clean and grease at the same time. Was a surprising amount of metal shavings in there - probably from the frame. The bearing surfaces and bearings were still in good shape. Contrary to previous reports on the web, there was a fair bit of grease on the bearings. Still, I cleaned it all off and replaced it. There are no dust seals on the crank, and through the gap in the cups, you can see the bearings rolling around. I added my own dust seal on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2016/IMG_20160409_083530423.jpg" &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrapped a bit more cotton string around at this point. The cotton string was thinner and tightened up more. This should slow dirt, dust and water entry into the bearings.  The thick thread above is large enough to not travel into the gap between the spindle and cup, and so not get caught up in the bearing.  Smaller thread just holds this tight on the spindle.     I've not pulled apart the wheel bearings yet, but maybe I should. They have grease visible outside the bearings, so I'm hopeful that there is grease inside.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney: More KMart Bike fixes.</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2016/04/2016-04-24-sydney-more-kmart-bi/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-24T18:13:00+10:00</published><updated>2016-04-24T18:13:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2016-04-24:/posts/2016/04/2016-04-24-sydney-more-kmart-bi/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After two council clean ups in the area - one awesome, and one disappointing.

&lt;figcaption&gt;The forks wear just looking at them.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More investigation found the shuddering was caused by the forks. They had a worrying amount of forward/backward movement. The brake grips the rim, the forks rock forward, the brake slips, the fork spring back. The brake grips again and on it goes.  Not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Plastic bush pulled out. No so visible in this pic, but it has flattened out.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cause was the plastic bushes wearing and flattening out. I knew this was going to happen and had wrapped the forks in plastic to keep grit out. That probably didn't slow the wear rate much. The forks on the Kmart Bike are the worst thing about it. The fix: convert to rigid forks.  Ideally, this would involve changing the forks. But the 'will this work' solution involved string, paper, hose clamps and epoxy resin.  Ideally, I wanted to disassemble them and change the spring in the base to a piece of metal pipe. But that needs a really long extension tool that I don't have. So with the plastic bush out as per the above photo. I wrapped string around the stanchion, and pressed it down with the bush into the fork. Checking with a piece of wire, I plugged any large gaps with paper, then filled the tube up with 5 minute epoxy resin. Before it set, I pushed the bush into it, so that resin was pushed back up filling all the gaps and channels in the bush. Effectively the top 60mm of the fork is now (hopefully) resin. Hose clamps went on the top of that, so if the fork does want to compress, they will stop it moving, or at least limit its movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the resin set, the forks are now rigid. Brake shuddering has gone. Time will tell how how travel affects the "fix". It might last months, or fail on the next ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KMart Bike adds excitement to each trip:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did check the wheel bearings. Well, at least the front ones. Heaps of grease in there. All good.  The rear, I realised I don't have the tool to get the cluster off, so they'll have to wait a bit longer. But grease is oozing out, so there is heaps in there.  The headset bearings also were well greased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other work was adding water bottle holders. I made these out of some aluminium strips found in the council clean up.  I can carry 10 litres in 1.25L PET bottles; two on each side of the forks, two in the triangle, and two behind the handlebars on the top tube. I still have the basket empty, so could put another couple of bottles in there.  All the water up front will balance the gear on the rear rack.  Gear weight is about 15kg and mostly (see below) fits in my two large homemade panniers. This is down from the 30kg I carried on the Surly.  I'm still not on board with 'minimal' though, I'll be leaving with way too much food for my route.  One day I'll get this right. So I'll work at reducing the food I've got and not stocking up so much each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I say "mostly", because I have two sleeping bags for now and while I can get both in my panniers, it is easier to keep one out on top of the rack in a dry bag. I use the sleeping bags as quilts. I'm using a $15 KMart summer weight sleeping bag. Synthetic, rated at 11C-15C, weighing 850 grams.  I've used this one down to 7C wearing thermals and clothing to bed, but I'm expecting lower temperatures in Northern NSW. So I scavenged another bag from a bin. It is missing a zipper, is synthetic, and weighs the same, so probably the same rating. With both, I sleep toasty. When I'm in Queensland and no longer need it, I'll return it to a bin. I won't need two bags again until winter next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My previous down sleeping bag was rated to about 0C, and I'd used it below wearing thermals and clothes. It weighed about 1500 grams, washing and drying it was not easy and I constantly was worried about it getting wet or damp. It would get dirty and salted. I'd get it cleaned by an outdoor company in Sydney at a cost of $60 a time, usually every second year.  After the last wash, the down was still clumping, so it needed replacing.  I was initially thinking of a new down bag. But at hundreds of dollars, and then the special washing needs, it wasn't very appealing. Most of the time, the temperature isn't below 10C and is above 15C.  The KMart bag at $15 is half the weight, easy to wash and dry. Can throw it in the washing machine and dryer. Though, depending on the laundromat costs, that could approach the cost of a new bag. Or I'll just replace it with another one. For the few months of winter when I need warmer, I'll add a second bag. The Kmart bag is much better value.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney - Cairns</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2016/07/2016-07-15-sydney-cairns/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-07-15T07:50:00+10:00</published><updated>2016-07-15T07:50:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2016-07-15:/posts/2016/07/2016-07-15-sydney-cairns/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I did leave Sydney with the K-Mart bike to head north.

&lt;p&gt;The body healed with rest, but then there was a family incident, so I flew to Cairns with just a the essentials in a backpack - electronics, sleeping bag, clothes, cooking gear, tarp, bug net and miscellaneous items. I like to be independent. The original plan was to either fly back to Sydney or walk with the backpack. However, the walk from the airport had me thinking that some wheels might be better. So after much searching about, I found some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds really alluring to just drop everything and go explore the world for the rest of your life. However, now isn’t the right time for me but in the future the option might just re-open for me as the thought is still present. Sydney is indeed a nice place to hit with so many attractions and sceneries to enjoy and countless other cities within Australia as well.&lt;/p&gt;

After the last post, 2016 can be summed up as 'lots of injuries and illnesses.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flew back to Sydney, with bits of my cart and stayed at a friends. Spent a lot of time waiting in doctors surgeries, taking tables, applying creams and ointments and hoping for a cure. I had a couple of skin infections from the tropics, but had three cases of bites (tick, leech, spider?)  that became swollen and infected also.  Besides losing some finger and toe nails, all turned out okay in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn't happy with the three wheeled pram, so had a period of building carts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another one wheeler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many more. Some didn't get finished before it became clear the design would not work.  Most where one and two wheels.  A solitary four wheel idea never made it off paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also was footwear experiments. Two of the wearable attempts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The footwear kept me busy the longest.  Walking started out simple, but then became more complicated. What could be so hard - put shoes on and walk. Most of us have this sorted by year one.  For me, years of bicycle riding (without stretching), with a lot of pushing a heavy bicycle on cambered road edges, in sandals that were too narrow for my feet had left me with more than a few problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides pain from my toes pressing together, my feet faced different directions - great for pushing loaded bike uphill, not so great for long distance walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought a pair of Vibram Five Fingers.  Loved them at first. Then they fell out of favour because they don't dry out as well as sandals. Gradually, they returned, though I change to sandals in the rain or on wet paths.  Back to being very fond of them.  Love the way your toes can spread out. I credit them for solving the toe press problems.  Standing barefeet, all my toes have a gap between them. Some smaller than others, but coming from needing to put foam spacers between some toes to sleep at night, this is a huge improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I walk barefoot more and more. I'd like to be barefoot full time, but roadside edges are not friendly places for bare feet: glass, thorns and metal fragments. I'm not willing to risk lack of mobility from injury.  Stepping on a rusty tin can, hidden in the grass is not a bare foot feeling I want to experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home made footwear making started as a search for an alternative to the Vibrams, that allowed my toes to spread out more. I found it hard to find sandals that don't cramp the toes.  Making your own footwear is interesting. There is more involved in it than it appears. The experimenting  continues - my current sandal is a combination of a commercial sandal that I cut apart with a different sole I glued on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>A brief catchup in time (part 2)</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2017/04/2017-04-06-a-brief-catchup-in-t/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-06T07:52:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-04-06T07:52:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2017-04-06:/posts/2017/04/2017-04-06-a-brief-catchup-in-t/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the clean up of gear, I sold my stove.

&lt;p&gt;I used this Evernew Titanium stove with pot stand for a while, but eventually I had enough of it.  The pot stand was a bit too small for my pot, and the pot slide on it easily, meaning you held the pot a lot or risked it falling off.  When the stove was warmed up, the flames would bulge downwards and almost scorch the ground around it. It needing a flame proof base.  Even with the fuel measurements stamps on the inside, it was hard to measure a small amount into it. There is fibreglass wool between the two walls, and this soaks up the fuel. Pour a small amount in, and it all vanished into the wool - how much is there? So you add more, till there is fuel visible in the bottom. The stove has to burn out - it isn't possible to blow or snuff it out. And it always kept the smell of fuel in it.  It did cook my lunch fast though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new stove would solve all these problems, make my lunch and clean up too.  I started making stoves
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2011/10/2011-10-10-perth-critical-mass-/"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href="http://zenstoves.net/"&gt;Zen stoves&lt;/a&gt;
has a wealth of stove types and build information,  but google found other interesting stove designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a several builds of stoves like the
&lt;a href="http://andrewskurka.com/2011/how-to-make-a-fancy-feast-alcohol-stove/"&gt;fancy feast&lt;/a&gt;
(see
&lt;a href="http://andrewskurka.com/2015/super-cat-fancy-feast-backpacking-alcohol-stove-flaws/"&gt;flaws of this stove&lt;/a&gt;
), and
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage-can_stove"&gt;some other variations&lt;/a&gt;
I decided I wanted something simpler.  Stoves that needed certain sized holes punched or drilled, precision cuts, carefull press fits or gluing ended up being too fiddly. When assembled correctly, they worked well, but I wanted simple and quick to make.  I also tried home build models with fibreglass wool wicks, stainless steel mesh tops like the
&lt;a href="http://www.woodgaz-stove.com/starlyte-stove.php"&gt;starlyte stoves&lt;/a&gt;
.  These decided that I didn't like not being able to see how much fuel was in the pot, nor the left over smell of fuel after using.  This might have been better if I had found a lid I could seal the stove with like the Starlyte offers.  Lots of hunting about shops for metal tins with fitted lids. Note: the website doesn't ship internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the testing,
&lt;a href="http://zenstoves.net/TeaLight.htm"&gt;tea candle stoves&lt;/a&gt;
seemed promising, but never held enough fuel to fully boil 2 cups (500ml) of water. It got close, but just not enough. Eventually I hit on the red bull can stove.  Find a red bull can. Cut the bottom off 25mm (1 inch) from the bottom. Done. Stove finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stove would hold enough fuel to boil 2 cups water for a few minutes. Was easy to make, easy to fill. Able to see how much fuel was left. Didn't need to be filled to the brim. Is very light. Lighter than the titanium stove!  If a red bull can can't be found, a coke can will do, but I found the red bull was easier to gauge the fuel amount when filling.  After it burns out, it cools quickly, so can be refilled for a second burn if needed.  (Two burns are needed for dry baking.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simmering is accomplished by a piece of aluminium foil bent over the top. Adjust as needed for the flame size.  This can also be used to snuff the flame out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coat hanger bent into shape is my pot stand. Easy to make, robust and non slip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I arrived at this point in my stove testing, I was over stove testing.  So even though it didn't cook lunch nor clean up, I stopped experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, I did try using tea candles to dry bake with, but didn't succeed. I suspect it was because I was using (claimed) 9 hour tea candles. The heat was never enough for the number of candles I could get under the pot.  All that happened was the pot was blackened with a waxy residue  and after about an hour I would end the test with raw dough.  Two burns of the red bull stove with the simmer cover is enough to bake one bread bun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other items that went in the gear clean up was my kitchen knife; 160 grams was too much knife. 500 grams of Useful string. You never know when you need to tie something up, or lots of somethings. But I decided I didn't need to carry quite that much weight in string.  Tent pegs were culled from 30 down to a more sensible number, though probably still to many. Battery packs from three to one. Stuff sacks had previously been breeding like rabbits - down to just a couple. Clothing - less of it, no more spares of spares.  Dropped the two snake bandages that I've carried since I started travelling.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Perth</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2017/07/2017-07-31-perth/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-31T16:47:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-07-31T16:47:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2017-07-31:/posts/2017/07/2017-07-31-perth/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Arrived in Perth busting to get walking and within the first week come a gutser.

After months of not being able to walk far, I rushed about to get gear ready and quickly ended up with sore knees. The next couple weeks, waiting for knees to heal, injured my feet. I had been sitting cross legged on a hardwood floor and the irritated the bone joint points on the outside edges of the feet that pressed into the floor. I stopped soon as it was sore, but the damage was done by that time.  Lesson: sit on soft things. Frustratingly, it seemed like all the fine days were drifted past as I waited for healing.  Eventually, went to see a podiatrist to check if there was anything I could do to heal faster as the feet were the worst problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First podiatrist was really bad.  With just a glance they could tell me that I needed an over $400 worth of X-ray and ultrasounds tests, that I definitely needed orthotics and a custom shoe fit.  All this was because in their words, my shoes were injuring my feet by rubbing on the sore spots. I had told them I hadn't been wearing shoes, and was always in sandals - that didn't touch the sore spots and hadn't walked in weeks because of sore knees.  Unhappy with that podiatrist and their diagnosis,  I went for a second opinion. Second podiatrist was much better. Video assessment of walking/running and the good news was all was good - no orthotics needed. The soreness, nothing to do but wait for that to calm down.  And obviously, don't do that again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To round out the doctors visits - I also saw a physio about the knees and a shoulder.  Got some exercises to do. But the big take away from the appointment was - get active. But gently!  Don't over do it.  Listen to your body and give it recovery time. So started back into walking training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footwear is still a problem for me. Why are shoes made with narrow pointed toes, when feet are broad and boxy shaped? Why can't you buy sandals in winter? Why is it so hard to get a good fit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried on so many shoe styles: running, hiking, walking , cross fit, gym, racing, and many more that I've forgotten. A big discovery was that I needed to move up a size or sometimes two depending on the brand.  Not so new discovery was that shoes are very narrow and made for uniform feet. I have very wide non uniform feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Left DIY soled. Right Merrell Siltwater Strap.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My DIY soled sandals worked, but the 2mm sole was wearing out. The low height also let a lot of debris under the foot when the track was anything but packed dirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the pair of Merrell sandals I had, but it seemed like they were irritating the sore points. The edge of the straps pressed right across the swollen spots. Wearing them was to uncomfortable for anything more than a short walk. I didn't like to wear them at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a time, I decided to stick to just wearing with a pair Vibram Five Fingers I had. They were good - well worn in and stretched.  Only problem was they were almost worn out. I added a shoe glue to the sole to extend their life a bit longer.  I wasn't going to replace them when they wore out, but in the end, failing to find another pair of sandals or shoes, and just wanting to stick to what was working, I ordered a new pair - exactly the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seemed all sorted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Old Vibram Five Fingers with Altra Instinct 3.5&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Murphy's law strikes. Checking them for the first time - just before a shakedown hike they broke.  Lace strap stitching come apart. It looks like the tabs missed the sewing machine. Back to the seller with them. I would have replaced them then, but they are now out of stock. I had the last pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired of trying on shoes, and needing something asap, I went and bought the best option I found locally; pair of
&lt;a href="https://www.altrarunning.com/"&gt;Altra Instinct 3.5&lt;/a&gt;
.  Altra is known for shoes with a human
&lt;a href="https://www.altrarunning.com/why-altra"&gt;foot shaped toe box&lt;/a&gt;.  Downside is finding a pair can be tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the old Vibrams, I was able to walk 12km days without a pack and feel good - foot wise - at the end of it.  First couple days in the new shoes and my feet were complaining bitterly. Not around the toes, but further back.  Its improving as they (shoes or feet?)  'break in', but I do miss sandals. Just put them on and adjust to comfortable. Adjust the velcro when needed - tight or loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shakedown hike is coming up to test out my gear, and my body. I've been paring my gear down to just the essentials.  Helpfully its the wet season, so plenty of water about.  I won't have to carry a solar panel for the phone charging either with all the clouds and rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

Less than 800km to go! Walked a couple of 30km days. The last had the 20km walk into town following it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of the day all is good, then get to the first hut and it's early and feeling good. Before lunch early. Enough time for another hut: double hutting. Eat up, shoes on, pack on and head off. After the first couple of km, thinking it was a mistake. Could have been resting back at the hut, but committed now, not turning back. The hours pass with lots of rests, stretching and more thoughts is why didn't I just stay at the last hut. Next time I will, I tell myself. Finally the hut is spotted and everything is better. Not better as in wake-up better, but relief that you've made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling it with tender feet after the 30km days. One small blister with the new Vibram Five Fingers. A seam at the end of a toe just touches. Will have tape that toe. Not sure what else I can do about that seam. Otherwise the Five Fingers are working well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail is easy walking, (if not double hutting). A lot of it is fire trails. Some parts are recovering from bush fires of the past, showing the different stages of recovery. Some good views from the mountain tops. Pleasant days with only the last couple threatening and delivering on showers. Sitting out two nights in town to miss further showers, winds, and a 2c overnight. A bit of a drop from the usual overnights. And of course washing, hot showers and food. Did I mention the caravan park huts are heated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail huts are wonderful. Not heated, but water tanks, seating and shelter. Can be busy though and I've slept out a couple of times under my tarp when they have been full. With fine weather a lot of people are out walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pack weight is about 11kg before food and water. At the moment I've about 500-600 grams of food a day at the moment. Water, at most 2 liters so far.  I'll leave Dwellingup with food for five days for the seven day walk. I'll eat before I leave town and have a small snack that night, last day not eat till I'm in Collie. Not a ultralight pack, but not super heavy. Not everyone's idea of comfort either. Just weighed it again. I'll leave with 15kg all up, including one liter of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A small annoyance is my sleeping system. No matter what I've tried, I wake up sweating and chilled. In the bag, using it as a quilt, thermals on/off, light cloths, naked. Early morning I'll wake sweating and chilly. It's been 5-12c nights. Lately had some success wearing all my cloths, sleeping without the bag till I get cool, then use the bag as a quilt with vent gaps around the edge. Not sure what the problem is.  One thought is the bag isn't breathing enough, trapping moisture, hence the venting helping. I'll try using a small throw blanket to see if that helps on the next six nights. I'm getting enough sleep each night, sleeping from sun down to midnight or later before waking the first time, then every couple of hours till first light. 12 hours nights at the moment. It would be nice to not wake sweating and chilled. If I can sort that out I'll cut down a bit more on clothing carried. But till then I get to mix and match at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In town, lots of eating. The cafe and pub serve large delicious meals. Then there is restocking the larder for the next leg. The local IGA has a good range of food for me. Breakfasts are oats, cashews, sultanas soaked over night. Chocolate, and trail mix, peanut butter, flat bread and some condensed milk make up the rest of the food.  Apart from breakfast, food is varied each day to make up  lunch/dinner. Best to save some to eat just before bed.  I'm not cooking, so less weight: no stove or fuel and only a peanut butter jar for soaking food. I'm calorie deficient on the meals, so am losing weight. Depending how much I lose, I'll have to increase the meals in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

While the first weeks were go hard and "do it", the last week had been more moderate. Taking it easy and pacing for the distance still to come.  Small aches and pains have crept in, and with the realisation of the  almost 700km to go, there's no wish to test the limits just yet and risk not finishing. Huts have been about 20km apart, also dampening the double hut enthusiasm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More fire trail walking with some single track. The fire trails varied from unexciting hard packed clay to interesting, rambling old paths. It's a bit of a chore on the unexciting roads as the mind wanders into day dreams. Suddenly wrenched back with gut clenching anxiety when you realise you haven't seen or looked for a trail marker in a while. Then the fear of "have you missed a turn off!", followed by profound relief when one is finally spotted. There follows a commitment to pay attention, but you keep drifting off.  The mind also wanders off on the single track, but less likely to miss a marker there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markers are not always as frequent as you'd like. The rule is keep going in the same direction as the last marker. That works, except when it doesn't. Everyone backtracks sometimes to check the last marker. Sometimes you need a very eagle eye to spot them. Looking backwards for the northbound markers can help, as looking for old markers. Sometimes you go forward with hope that another will appear. If it doesn't, your lost. Go back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a fall on one slippery clay section of track. The Vibram Five Fingers grip like a gecko on rock, but on clay it's like walking on ice. Both feet and hands into the muddy wheel ruts. More unhappily, the hip belt on my pack tore. I completed the next four hours with it leaning drunkenly to one side, leaving a sizeable bruise on one side. My pack is a Mountain Mule. An external frame pack which I'm told by more knowledgeable older walkers is at least 30 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gifted it one night, about midnight. It was pouring rain. A slight fog.  I was walking a suburban street when a beam of light broke through the gloom, striking the pack buried deep in a rubbish heap on the kerb. It called to me. And after some digging, I liberated it and it's accompanied me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an external frame pack, with two sections. The bottom section is closed by a zipper. The top by a flap of fabric that ties shut. Neither seem large enough.  Apart from some adjustments to the straps, and replacing a missing pin with a bolt, if not done anything else to it. The fall tore the stitching on the hip belt. But a couple hours sewing and it's better than it was. As good as new I declared the next day. During the repairs I removed the belt and on restoring it, tried a different attachment pattern that is a bit more comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sleeping system problems have been solved by the addition of a small polyester lap blanket. Bought at Dwellingup for $7. It's small 1.27m x 1.35m, but big enough to cover most of me if I scrunch up. I lie down, drap the blanket over, then put the sleeping bag over like a quilt. I think the blanket stops the cold air getting in, while allowing warm moist air to leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still using two foam mats. The K-Mart mats compress with time and lose insulation ability. Starting at about 1cm thick when new, one is now 3mm think. The limit of its compression. The other newer mat is a more robust 5mm thick. I'm unable to part with the thinner mat as testing has shown that both needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One particular morning was very brisk. I set out walking along a path bordered with frost. But since then the temperatures have shot up with about 9C nights and some 25C days. It's so much warmer sleeping and with the weather that I'm contemplating leaving behind my fleece jumper in Collie. A sizeable space saving. I'll also leave my pants behind. With weight loss they are too loose, and chaff on my legs. Back to lycra bicycle pants, unpadded courtesy of the local Target store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next section is 12 days to the next large town, but with two small shopping options before then. Much thought expended on how much food to take. Enough for 12 days, or enough to get to the small shops. With my no cook meal plan, I'm wary of limited choices, so am taking food for seven days with a parcel sent ahead for the last five days. Still on minimal rations, but increase the amount slightly. I arrived in Collie with no food left having finished everything the day earlier. I was lucky to get another block of chocolate and bag of peanuts before leaving Dwellingup, and had some fruit cake kindly left at one of the huts. Without that, it would have been a very hungry arrival in Collie.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Balingup</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2017/09/2017-09-14-balingup/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-14T20:39:00+10:00</published><updated>2017-09-14T20:39:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2017-09-14:/posts/2017/09/2017-09-14-balingup/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Town's are nice enough; food, gear, water and washing.

Not slow walkers either, arriving at the next shelter before lunch.  Lots of interesting stories though about the track and characters on it.

&lt;p&gt;Mostly the same people at each shelter at night. Unless someone takes a rest day or double huts. Town's swap it about a bit. People staying longer, or leaving early. You hope for the non snorers. Had the early risers lately. Up at 4:30 to pack and have breakfast and start walking at first light to arrive at the next shelter before lunch. Then they'd have a nap.

Feet have not been dry for over a week. Each day is put on wet socks and wet shoes. Some of the water has been hip high. But long sections of ankle or shin high wading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bright spot is that the weather might be fine this next week. Okay, the occasional shower is forecast, but I'm hopeful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Made some gaters today from a pair of tights, cardboard milk cartons and some duck tape. Also bought some tradie sock savers to go with my gaters to help keep sand out of my Vibram Five Fingers.  The arrival at the coast has been accompanied by walking through small scratchy bushes. My legs are getting scratched raw in places. I've been walking in knee high bicycle shorts since Collie after my pants became too loose.  I'm hopeful that the milk cartons are also snake bite proof as well. Though the plan is to not test that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cut the tights in half from the crotch through to the waist band, and sewed up each half into a long tube. I pull one half onto my leg, wrap the two milk cartons joined with duck tape around my calf. They stay overlapping, and then I roll the top of the tights down over them to hold them in place. The sock saver at the bottom holds the bottom together. Bike shorts at the top help hold it up. Short walk testing today seemed promising. Time will tell. I'll have duck tape with me to make any repairs needed in case.  But I'm sure no more scratched legs and hopefully less sand in my shoes and really hopefully snake protection.  Not seen any snakes since Donnley River, but keep hearing about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only about 200km to go. Suddenly the end is in sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello Megan. I assume from your last few posts that you're walking on the Bibbulman Track. I haven't even seen it, let alone walk on it. I wonder if I ever will walk it after reading that the water in some places was hip-high! Was that water on the track, or were you on a detour? If I had to walk for a few days with water everywhere, I reckon my feet would turn into mush!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I find your current story very interesting and always look forward to the next instalment. I hope you enjoy this new adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi John, Sorry for the delay. Yes, I was hiking the Bibbulmun Track. Finished yesterday in Albany, and just arrived back in Perth, hence catching up on email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The area with the water is on the track and is marked as "seasonally inundated". I was there in the right (or wrong) season. In Autumn, I'm told the whole area is dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly my feet are still attached. Reckon the tannins in the water might have helped. Least that's what I'm telling myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving Denmark, I stayed overnight at Nullaki Campsite, intending to skip the next shelter and go to the Torbay Campsite.  One of the concerns for the walk was the inlet crossings. Either a short walk across the inlet, or a long road diversion.  Torbay Inlet was the last remaining inlet to cross. I'd met a northbound hiker just before entering Denmark. He told me that Torbay Inlet was flowing too fast, and he took the 20km road diversion. But he got lucky and got a lift.  The Torbay Campsite is 8km before the inlet. My plan was to walk to the inlet and cross it.  Well, hopefully cross it, if not, that left the rest of the day for the diversion walk, and the additional kilometers after the diversion to the next shelter.  It would be a big day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day was wet, cold, and windy.  I felt like I was in a demented washing machine walking along the coastal trail. Wind gusting strong enough to push me about the track, or trash me with the bushes.  I arrived early enough at West Cape Howe shelter to continue to the Torbay shelter, but it just didn't happen. Besides the weather, I come up with the plan that the water flowing out of the inlet would be slower at high tide - which would be at about 12:20.  If I walked the 16.5km to Torbay shelter the next day and then continued to the inlet, I'd get there close to high tide, and then of course I'd cross. That was the big hope. Failing to cross, I'd either have to return to the Torbay shelter, or start the unappealing 20km road diversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday, off I set for Torbay. All was going to plan. As I walked along the beach, I met a local and asked him about the inlet. The news wasn't good. He said it was too deep and too fast to cross. He'd watched two guys crossing with packs held over their heads a couple days ago and it was chest high then. More rain would have make it higher and faster. This was bad. But he suggested going there as since it was Sunday maybe some boat people were about on the bay and I could get a lift across. As I looked at the wind and showers gusting in, the white caps on the waves and foam on the beach, I doubted anyone would be out. But to get the road diversion I had to go to the inlet anyway. I'd decided that I wouldn't return along the beach to the campsite. It was onwards no matter what.  He also warned me about the creek outflow that had to be crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creek was deep. I walked along the side for a bit before finding a spot to cross - stepping across deep channels onto islands. When I did have to wade, it was knee high. Not promising for the inlet if this was the creek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On I walked, thinking about how long it was going to take to walk around the diversion.  I wasn't entirely sure where I was along the beach section, just kept going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inlet when I came to it was tiny. I wasn't even sure it was the inlet till later in the walk when the track left the beach. It was ankle deep, but crossing it a wave splashed me and my knees got wet.  Never believe what people tell you - make up your own mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made the day a 40km day, and would have gone higher, but the last 12km into Albany would have run out of daylight.  The next day, in a break with the recent weather was fine and sunny.  Was nice doing a slow walk around the bay into Albany. Then sitting in the sun eating lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can now say I've walked the

&lt;p&gt;I completed the walk in 50 days total.  Starting 20 August 2017 in Kalamunda and finishing 9 October 2017 in Albany.   I had a four zero days (days of not walking on trail at all): one in Mt Cooke campsite, two in Dwellingup, one in Collie. I wasn't trail fit before starting. My "training" was going for a morning walk of about 12km along the Perth riverbank carrying a mobile phone, listening to music or podcasts. The day in Kalamunda was the first day I put the loaded pack on.  The plan was to walk and if I run into problems I could return to Kalamunda or bail out along the roads nearby.  I had the first resupply near at Sullivan's Rock, where I had another chance to call it quits if I was struggling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rest day was had at Mt Cooke campsite because the resupply near Sullivan Rock was on the Saturday.  I'd thought if I was running late, I could delay it a day. But I didn't think if I was ahead of schedule. So I walked to Mt Cooke campsite on Friday, and on Saturday walked back the 5km to the meetup point. I had intended to go to the next shelter that day. But due to a big stuff up (forgetting the rest of the maps in the car) I had to return again to the meetup point. So managed 20km and finished back in Mt Cooke in the afternoon.  I took a zero the next day to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't pre book any accommodation before starting. Some were booked on the trail. Others I just arrived and looked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwellingup and Collie were where I had rest days in town. After that I kept walking onwards.  I would have taken more zero days in Pemberton but it was the long weekend, and the start of school holidays. No rooms left in the backpackers, so booked into a more expensive motel.  I found out later that people cancelled because of the rain and I could have got a room at the backpackers rather than stay at the motel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walpole was also only the one night because I wanted to get ahead and have a chance at solo shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denmark, I was planning a rest day, but got lucky and was offered a trip around the bay while I was sitting outside the IGA eating. Since this was before I would have checked into the backpackers, I headed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Albany I stayed overnight. This was because I wasn't' sure if I could make it to the end before the bus left. As it was I was there with plenty of time. But it was nice to not have to worry about making time. That last day on the trail was an unusually fine day - the first in a long time.  There are three busses that leave to Perth - which I only figured out when talking to the helpful staff at the booking office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Northern half was dry weather. Missed the couple of days of showers by arriving in town for resupply just as they started and leaving a couple days later when it was over.  Also missed showers by arriving in shelter before they started. Or they were so gentle that rain gear wasn't put on.  So all dry walking.  The southern half seemed all the opposite. All wet weather. Every day was rain gear - sometimes on/off multiple times.  Seemed to be constantly wading through water between Northcliff to Denmark. More so Northcliffe to Walpole. Diverted around Lake Manjimup because of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snakes - saw one on Snake road heading into Donnelly River.  The only other time I saw snakes was just after Peaceful Bay - a day I didn't have my gaiters on. I think I saw so few most of my walking was in the morning.  That day after Peaceful Bay was probably the only 'warmer' day where I was on the trail after lunch.  Other post lunch walking days were wet, cloudy or cool, so the snakes weren't out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there was a concern about rats or mice in all the campsites, I wasn't worried about them until Mount Franklin campsite. There, rats chewed my water bags. I'd hung everything else up. Don't know why they chewed my water bags, but that left me on minimum water carrying capacity.  They seemed to get lots of people there. After that I took the signs much more seriously and hung everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All inlets were crossed. Torbay had a  'too deep, too fast' reports from a north bound section hiker and locals. But ended up being only shin deep when I arrived at high tide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only lost the trail a few times - missed markers when not looking or daydreaming.  But soon realised and got back on track. There were more times where I was uncertain if I was still on the trail. But the general deal was keep going in the same direction as the last marker you saw. Also, look backwards to spot the reverse direction markers.  Look to footprints on the trail or trekking pole marks. A lot of time it was also follow the tire marks.  After a while developed 'waugal' skills, and was able to spot them seemingly no matter where they where placed or hidden. One memorable carpark after Torbay Inlet had the Waugal hidden behind parked cars.  Also got better at figuring where the track was likely to go based on the terrain. Having the paper maps definitely helped more times than not.  I never used the gps to check if I was on trail - because my phone was buried in my pack, but I did met walkers who didn't have any maps an only relied on the markers and their gps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a lot of other people on the trail. Most were at the northern end on the weekend.  Apart from the other end to enders, there was section hikers, overnighters and day walkers.&lt;/p&gt;

I've also a reluctance to buy expensive gear if something cheaper does the job "good enough". Spending more money doesn't necessarily mean better or guarantee the best experience.  This is the gear I used. It may not work for you, but it might give you some ideas of what is possible.  I'm not listing everything I carried, just the main items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had camped before, but in my bicycle traveling days I was a big pack rat - 40kg of gear. This was my first backpacking trip and I made an effort to cut the weight down. Lighter is better, especially when carrying it on the back.  My base weight was about 10kg. This is everything in the pack, including the pack, except consumables: food, fuel (that I didn't have), water, etc. I could have been lighter, but had 'spare items' or 'backup items' in case something failed or didn't work. I had stuff that strictly wasn't needed for the whole hike. eg I carried all the maps after the first resupply all the way to the end. Others discarded used maps, or only had the map for the current section.  I also had stuff that at the end of the hike I hadn't used at all,  that with more experience wouldn't have been taken in the first place. So there was room to lighten my load.  There were lighter base weight hikers. They were more experienced hikers, (some having hiked the Bibbulmun track multiple times already), were not carrying tents. They had spent significantly more on their equipment. Another strategy used was to use a bounce box. Mailing a box ahead to the next town, with items not need for that section. eg. town clothes, maps, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2017/IMG_20171210_174123334.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My pack was an old external frame "Mountain Mule" pack - last made in the 60's or 70's I was told by some of the more knowledgeable (read: older) hikers.  I'd found it on the curb during a council cleanup. Someone threw it out!  The straps were set up weird. I never did figure out who could have used it: man, woman or child. I adjusted all the straps to get it to fit and be comfortable. Other than adjustments, I did minimal changes: added some small bits of plastic to cover a couple of sharp points that I worried might catch on my shirt.  That was it. On the trail, I had to sew patch the hip belt attachment point after a fall broke some of the stitching. I did this twice as the first time my  stitching pulled though. The second time I added a small bit of webbing to reinforce the point. In the photo it is the small bit of yellow on the hipbelt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main bag is in two separate compartments. The bottom with a zipper, the top with a draw string closure, with a top flap cover that uses string to tie it closed to the bottom of the pack. There are two side pockets with zippers per side. I kept water bottles in these. There is one small pocket on the top flap cover with a simple material fold closure.  This I used for my rubbish bag.  There is a small zippered pocket on the bottom compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2017/IMG_20171210_174315084.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2017/IMG_20171210_174315084.jpg"  /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I was happy with the pack. It was comfortable, though as the hike progressed the hipbelt started to break down as the internal foam collapsed most likely because of its age. This caused it to press a bit more in some places than others. Without a rest break it would get bothersome and I'd move the hipbelt about to have the spot press a new location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't like the two separate compartments as it was sometimes  difficult to fully pack the bottom zippered compartment. I didn't want to overstuff the compartment as I was worried that stitching might fail and leave me with a repair on the trail. So it often had empty space that I thought could have been used better if the bag was one large compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wet weather protection was a garbage bag in each compartment. Nothing in the bags got wet. Put the garbage bag in and pack gear into it. Important items also were in dry bags. I didn't want to using dry bags as they are heavier than garbage bags, but I had them, and they were my backup option if the pack material failed because of age. I had three 20L dry bags. The backup plan was that everything could fit in dry bags, and I'd tie them to the frame with the ample cord that I had, and then be able to keep going on the hike. Overall one was for food, one for sleeping gear/clothing and the third for electronics. 20L bags were too big and full they wouldn't fit in the pack compartments, so day to day everything didn't go in them. Hence needing the garbage bags for waterproofing. Electronics was the only item that consistently ended up in a dry bag. On days with no chance of rain, the dry bags were sometimes not used at all -just rolled up and packed with everything just in the compartments.  The pack had minimal material - so even with it getting wet it dried out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annoyances: the lack of easily accessible small pockets with the pack on. Accessing anything, I had to take the pack off.  I used the side pockets for water: bags empty or full, a PET bottle and a water filter.  Apart from a tube of chaff cream in a side pocket, everything else had to be accessed in the top compartment - undo the strings, open the drawstring, and then open whatever bag was needed. I wanted a small bag at the front - like a bum bag - to keep stuff like snacks, phone, etc. As it was I only had my shirt pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried the sleeping mats (see below) on top of the bag -  annoying to open the top compartment. Underneath - meant the bag wouldn't sit up when you put it down.  Lastly, vertically at the back. This worked the best. The bag would sit up vertically and I could access the top compartment. It also gave a narrower profile - which was important for fitting through some gaps between trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd be classed as a side sleeper. I can fall asleep on a hardwood floor, so a thin CCF foam mat is sufficient for me. My CCF foam pad from K-Mart: $8 or $10. The sleeping mat insulates you from the ground and is very important for sleeping warm. You can lose a lot of heat downwards by conduction. From my bicycle travelling days, I knew I could use a foam mat happily no matter how compressed, unless it was below 10C and especially not on rock or cement. In those cases, one mat isn't thick enough insulation. I'd not tested on a wooden platform, but guessed that it would not be a problem as wood is more of an insulator than rock or cement. Ground sleeping I'd find the 'soft spot' - on leaf litter - which is a good insulator if thick enough. The Kmart mats compress over time. I use them nightly - even when staying with friends or in hotels or cabins; I still sleep on the floor with a mat. The pad I took, I'd used nightly for several months before the hike started and it had collapsed a bit. It continued to collapse, and I found the wooden platforms cooler than I had though. At my first resupply I got a second pad (that had even more nights use on it) and doubled them up. Near the end of the hike, the second pad was doubled up on itself and only used under my torso. So effectively I had three layers of pad under my torso. But it was still thinner than a new pad. By this time the overnight temps were warmer, but next time I would start with a newer Kmart pad.  Carrying two pads - even though they had compressed was still bulky compared to one new pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2017/IMG_20171105_081339268.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2017/IMG_20171105_081339268.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeping bag was a 1.06kg $85 (on sale) synthetic bag from Anaconda. Only purchased as my usual Kmart Summer bag isn't rated below 10C and that was expected.  I didn't take the stuff sack with me - but squashed it into a $10 Kmart 20L dry bag (that would have weighed more), or just into the bottom compartment in a garbage bag. I didn't use a bag liner - sleeping in thermals, light clothing or everything at one point early on. I also rarely used the bag as a bag - using it as a quilt over the top of me. I sprawl about sleeping, and find zipped up bags confining. But if cold, would try zipped up. Not as good as a quilt - as the bag has different thicknesses on the "bottom" and the "top". Also the hood was not that useful, or the baffles about the top and to seal around the zipper. So it is heavier than a quilt would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I had problems with waking up cool - usually just after midnight and continuing till morning. The first two weeks were spent trying different combinations of sleep wear and bag zipped up or open, to try and work out why. The first resupply I had a second sleeping bag for one night as a further test. A $12 Kmart synthetic summer bag that I use on the east coast. I spread it over the top to increase the warmth. It didn't help. The conclusion I come to was that the Anaconda bag wasn't breathing well - so moisture couldn't escape, I'd eventually get damp, and then chilled and wake up. Trying to leave vent gaps just let in cool air.  It wasn't bad enough to want to stop hiking, but it was mildly annoying. Adding a small (127 cm x 130 cm) $7 synthetic lap blanket purchased in Dwellingup shop - improved sleeping comfort immeasurably and I never woke cold again. This weighed 330 grams. I still used the bag as a quilt. Coldest night was then about 2C, and I just slept in light clothing and was toasty arm. So with thermals and clothing I would have been able to sleep in lower temps. I used the blanket in camp as a cape - wrapped around me sitting or standing for warmth at times.  After getting the blanket I discarded my op shop fleece jumper in Balingup to free up pack space - as I found the blanket was smaller, lighter, warmer and more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't take a stove or cooking pot. I was "no cook". Reason for this was to save weight and pack space. I've been "no cook" in the past bicycle travelling, so knew it wouldn't be a problem for the trip. Food was purchased in towns as needed. Except for a parcel send by a friend to Donnelly River Village I didn't have mailed resupply. The parcel was to resupply for the next five days - but due to a miscommunication, the food was unsatisfactory, so I discarded most of it and used left overs and items purchased at Donnelly River Village to get to Pemberton.  It was minimal rations for that section and I was hungry on arrival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My method was generally wake up, pack up and start walking. Get to the shelter and eat, which was usually about lunch time. Save something for a bit of a snack closer to evening, but eat most of the food for lunch.  Sometimes I planned a snack before lunch or had a "breakfast", but most times didn't. Various trail mixtures, peanuts, cashews, almonds and chocolate was the main food items. Muesli, oats, sultanas, tinned fish, packet fish, snack bars also had an appearance at different times.  Trail mix and chocolate was a reliable resupply. Calorie dense food. A block of chocolate is about 1000 calories. Trail mix was about 2000 calories. Together they weighed about 600 grams. I always planned to eat before leaving town - so only needed an afternoon snack for that day. The day arriving in town, the plan was to have no food left for that day as I would eat on arriving in town. With unplanned double hutting or not eating enough, only once did I get into town with nothing left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My tent was a silpoly 3x3 meter tarp with a Sea to Summit nano bug net with a plastic groundsheet. Using trekking poles, I could put this up "free standing". But usually I'd use a tree or two.  I'd used this previously so was comfortable with it. On the trail I used it a few times - when shelters were full or when I wanted to camp away from the shelter. I carried way too much cordage with me. Some was for the fall back pack mending with dry bags option. But even then, I had more than I needed, and I gathered more cordage that I found discarded at camp sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trekking poles were some ebay $16 items. Nothing special about them. I had to mend one with epoxy in Dwelling up as the hand grip was slipping. I definitely found the poles useful for walking. Helped with balance especially when wading through water or walking on clay. My one fall, was on clay, and the poles slipped out also. I had the rubber tips on, when it would have been more sensible to have removed them. I did prefer the rubber tips on though - they didn't sink into the ground as much. But after the fall, I did the rubber tips when on long clay sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clothes were op-shop or low cost K-mart purchases - apart from shoes and socks. I had the clothing I was walking in, thermals and clothing to sleeping in, and a town set. Long trousers would have been better for the coastal section as the brush there is scratchy. More on this below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footwear generates a lot of discussion. The "you need boots - thick, strong, waterproof, ankle support, high laces, etc." seem the most vocal. People do use trail runners or joggers. Online I've read of barefoot hikers.  Other hikers wore a mixture of boots, shoes, insoles. Some had problems with blisters, or soreness in various parts of the foot some didn't. Find what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My shoes and socks were different and gathered a lot of comments on and off trail. Apart from electronics, they are my most expensive purchase. Vibram Five Fingers. Also known as "barefoot shoes". This model is the "Trek Ascent" with a 4mm layer of rubber, and a 4mm insole. Total of 8mm. Thin enough to feel what you are walking on. Vibrams are not waterproof. Water enters and leaves fast. This was an advantage in the wet and water wading sections. But equally,  morning dew or just wet ground would leave me with wet socks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socks, unsurprisingly, need to be toe socks. Injini are the goto brand and usually found about $20 a pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've worn Vibram Five Fingers before. Do take notice of the need to change gradually. Most shoes that people wear have the heel raised. Five Fingers don't - they are known as zero drop shoes (The "drop" is a measure of the heel to top drop).  Changing from a heel to zero drop suddenly can cause problems as the body needs to adjust to the change.  While they were not my 
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2017/07/2017-07-31-perth/"&gt;first choice&lt;/a&gt;
they were what I ended up walking in. They worked well for me. I started with an older pair (size 44)  and switched to a  newer pair (size 45) at the first resupply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this pair, one toe pocket has a slightly malformed seam right at the tip. One day after wearing them for a week, I developed a tiny blister from this on the tip of my big toe. That day was a 'long day', enough dampness to have wet feet, and I was hurrying. So wasn't paying attention or willing to stop to check what was happening. I did think later, that not tightening the lace would probably have been the reason my toe was able to touch the front. Not wanting to mess about with a blister,  I put tape over it and never had problems again. Since the hike, I've worn this pair without the tape and without getting a blister.  I also put tape on the center part of one foot - no blister, it just felt odd and I was concerned about it, so after a while I tried tape to see if that made a difference. It felt better, so I just kept the tape on after that. The tape once applied stayed for about a week before peeling off - so usually removed it on the first shower in town, and reapplied it on the morning of leaving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have to pay attention to foot placement and the terrain. I couldn't blindly blunder along.  Walking with other (fast) hikers - I was slightly slower walking in some places because of this. That said, overall, I was a fast walker compared to others on the trail. Apart from the blister above, I didn't have any foot injuries while wearing these shoes. There were rare steps were there was something uncomfortable underfoot - but that meant that I didn't put full weight down on that part of the foot. Some parts on the trail with lots of gum nuts, I'm not sure how I managed to walk through without stepping on them. Sometimes I'd look back and think: how'd I manage that! I think the brain learns to work out where to put the feet from a glance, even without you having to constantly pay attention. I noticed that the foot strike changed step to step: sometimes forefoot, sometimes midfoot strike, sometimes heel. Each step was different. Roads and cement paths feel boring - each step exactly the same over and over. The trail was more interesting.  Heel striking was often with "stepping out" - trying to take big steps. I found that shorter steps felt better than longer steps. Also gives more options for foot placement and to shift weight about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the cost of Vibrams, and toe socks, and the difficulty of finding stock, the only downside I had was the grip. They have phenomenal grip on rock but terrible on clay.  Guess its a trade off - other hikers had better grip on clay, but terrible on rock.  But there was more clay walking than rock on the Bibbulmun, especially on the southern half where there was water to wade though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Homemade gaiter.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I walked in a long sleeve shirt, shorts or gym tights until Walpole, were I made some 'gaiters' from a pair of old tights and 4 cardboard milk cartons and string. Some of the trail was very narrow with scratchy bushes heading into Walpole and I was getting scratched on the legs a lot. Concerned this might continue on the coastal sections I made gaiters, but didn't find this was the case after Walpole.  It very much depends on when the trail was last maintained. The section into Walpole hadn't been cut back recently - so the bushes were closer to the trail. I ended up wearing my gaiters some days, but not others. When making the gaiters I thought they could also be 'snake proof', based on how thick the material of the milk carton was. It was thicker and harder than gaiters others had purchased and were wearing. Though, I never saw a snake while wearing the gaiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain coat was a $4 plastic poncho with a garbage bag skirt. The poncho was put on and the pack put on over the top. Shoulder straps and hip belt stopped it billowing about. I did have a old Marmot rain jacket - that is no longer a waterproof - that I used as a coat under, or in high winds, over the plastic poncho.  I also use this jacket to help with warmth in camp as another layer, or when it was windy as a wind block.  I'd like to find a silnylon jacket - as it would be lighter, but as I have this Marmot jacket I use it. Besides its lack of waterproofness, it is in great shape for the many years I've had it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water filter. All the rainwater tanks had a warning about the water needing treatment. A lot of people drank without treating the water. They had various beliefs about why it was safe, and not necessary to treat the water.  I used a Sawyer Squeeze and always filtered my water. There were a few other hikers that also treated their water. One had a Sawyer Mini. Comparing size and filtering speed, the Mini  was significantly slower to filter for minimal weight savings.  Given a choice, get the the Squeeze.  I had an adaptor to backflush the filter with me, but didn't use it. A few times when the filter seemed to slow down I'd leave it attached to the bag and standing upright. So that water would drain backwards into the bag. Sometimes I'd even blow to push the water into the bag. I'd then discard this water. It seemed to help. In town I'd flush it under a tap using my hand as a connector.  Online some overseas hikers reported that the Sawyer bags had failed for them. I carried a 1.25 PET bottle in case this happened. I suspect it depends on how the bags are treated. With the rainwater minimal effort was needed to filter the water, so I doubt they would have failed. A rat did chew holes in two of the bags at one shelter.  I don't know if the rat was unable to chew the PET bottle, or gave up without trying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carried a trowel - a $3 children's garden trowel from Bunnings. Only used it once.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Southern Highlands</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2017/12/2017-12-30-southern-highlands/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-30T21:58:00+11:00</published><updated>2017-12-30T21:58:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2017-12-30:/posts/2017/12/2017-12-30-southern-highlands/</id><summary type="html">&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Headed off for a few days to test some gear and to explore the area where I was to camping a bit more. The gear test happened, the explore - no so much.  I'd forgotten about holidays. There seemed to be some events happening so I mostly stayed to one corner of the area and watched the passing traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gear tested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cart is small - not much larger than a "seniors shopping cart".  It has done a few trips with me about the suburbs, though, with how I load it, it looks less like a shopping cart, and more like a homeless persons'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main reason for using this cart is it is not much larger than a shopping cart and that it can fold down. A bonus is that  wheels are gel filled - so no punctures. It has a weight capacity of 200kg, but my load was more modest.  The picture to the left shows it with 20 litres of water capacity on the bottom and my newish pack sitting on top. On the outbound trip there was nothing strapped on the outside.  But the sudden realisation just at 5am that I had less than an hour to pack and make my way to the distant train station, meant packing shortcuts. Surprisingly nothing fell off while running on bush tracks and corrugated dirt roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cart worked surprisingly well.  Total load was approximately 40kg including the cart.  The 8" wheels handled the bitumen and dirt roads, soft sand and across country hauling without too much resistance. Larger wheels are better and I had hopped, but the larger diameter wheeled carts didn't fold and were much larger and heavier.  Pushing the cart was preferable. But pulling was better over rough ground or on steep uphills. I was able to easily drag the cart fully loaded over downed trees. The downside of pulling was it was best to be facing backwards and pulling the cart. Facing forward and pulling the cart behind - unless done always with two hands on the cart, resulted in a twisting force on the body. My knees complained after I pulled it one handed over obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More thought is needed on the cart use for offroad use.  I liked not carrying the weight. But the cart weight is fixed and moving it involved a certain amount of effort and course selection. With less gear, could I have carried the my gear and water, and not had the cart?  I plan to repeat the trip soon - while the weather is similar and test the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My newish 65L pack was an $80 impulse buy. Initially it seemed an great deal. With more time and use, I have some dissatisfaction with it. One issue is that to use the outside pockets - unless for small items - they require space from the main body of the pack.  From the above picture - if the main body of the pack was packed tight - then the water bottle would not fit. I could (and might) cut the fabric and add more material in to stop this.  The rear mesh pocket is so small as to be almost useless.  I added several tap loops and elastic cord to be able to hold items in this pocket. There are other pockets - that also remove space from the internal body of the pack - not so handy I think. Added weight without much benefit. The internal frame is a solitary stay in the center of the pack. While this seemed okay at first, it doesn't distribute the weight as well as having two stays. I've thought of moving the centre stay and adding a second, but haven't yet. It may be better to just replace this pack than do to extensive modifications.  I did however make some other small modifications.  It had a small pocket on the side of the hipbelt. I cut this off and reattached it further forward on the belt. Where it was located, my arm hit it with each swing of my arm. My greatest addition was to the base of the pack where I crafted a pouch with several velcro closing pockets. It added three separate carry locations.  Unfortunately, while it seemed a great idea, and took me a long time to sew up, using it wasn't so great. The material was too heavy for what was needed, and the velcro not easy to open and close.  I removed it on returning as it added too much weight for little benefit. I'll have another attempt using lighter fabric and either elastic closures or a zipper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sleeping bag from the Bibbulmun track walk had a meeting with the scissors. I nearly always use a sleeping bag like a quilt - as I move about a lot and find zipped up sleeping bags too confining. It weighted 1067 grams without the stuff sack. (I don't use the stuff sack.) After meeting the scissors, it weighted 683 grams. I cut off the hood, zippers and zipper baffles to turn it into a flat quilt. While on the camp, I sewed the foot box up again. I found I liked having a foot box. Without it, I kept poking my feet out the bottom.  I didn't add straps to hold the quilt down  - so more care was needed rolling over.  The zipper and baffles did help keep the edges of the bag down. I might add straps in the future. I might also add a closure for the top.  I like the lighter weight of the quilt, but as I'm still using it with a lap rug when the temps drop towards (and below) 10C, there is still room for improvement here.  It will do for summer use with temps greater than 10C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other gear change was not taking gear. Even so, with culling down what I wanted to take, I still ended up with necessary gear adding weight and bulk. Sitting in my shelter on the second night looking at the stuff I had, too much of it was unnecessary. I keep packing "comfort items" - items that I don't really need, don't add comfort, add weight and bulk, but that seem vitally important when thinking about what "might be needed".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time - take less.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Southern Highland, the beyond</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2018/01/2018-01-11-southern-highland-th/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-11T08:03:00+11:00</published><updated>2018-01-11T08:03:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2018-01-11:/posts/2018/01/2018-01-11-southern-highland-th/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The return trip was without the cart; carrying everything.

Of that 12.5 kg was water with 10 L in one container. It quickly got old carrying that one: both arms in front, left arm, right arm. Even tried sitting it on my head for a bit. Was very thankful that the walking in was over. The cart, for the problems it had, was definitely better for transporting a load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Followed my own advice and had less gear, so walking around without the water was a lot easier.  Total pack weight was less than 9kg. I left behind items that in the past I'd considered essential. Less clothing, less food, less camp items. It wasn't as uncomfortable as I thought it might be, and more after a few more test camps it settings normal. While there, I tested some other ideas; wearing less clothing to sleep and sleeping mat size. The outcome was that I now cut my sleeping mat shown to torso length, and I no longer carry a set of thermals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bug net wasn't midge proof. It was only for mosquito. It was also getting rather a lot of holes in it. After much deliberation I ordered a tent. 750gm total with tent pegs. But it does need a hiking pole to erect it. Spacious it isn't. Body bag or coffin comes to mind. It seemed a good idea at the time. Lots of testing showed it wanted perfectly flat ground to put it up. I have doubts that the fly is the same model as the inner. But I did figure out how to put it up. The first night I used it, I was glad to be in it when it started raining. Lying there, I couldn't imaging trying to get in if it was raining, or pack up in the rain. I threw out the fly and returned to using the tarp. The inner I've kept and use under the tarp.  The tarp has a lot of space under it, and I can put it up fast. When it's raining, put the tarp up first, then hang out under it in the dry. Set up the bug net, spread out wet gear. Packing up is the reverse. Easy peasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been on the road a few days now living out of my pack. It still needs some more tweeking. I still have too much gear with me. And I think I can do better with what I do have.  As in change it for something else or use it differently to how I am currently.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Houseless in Sydney</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2018/02/2018-02-03-houseless-in-sydney/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-03T12:04:00+11:00</published><updated>2018-02-03T12:04:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2018-02-03:/posts/2018/02/2018-02-03-houseless-in-sydney/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I needed to leave my friend's house sit.

The plan was to walk south, and I did start. But, as they do, plans change. Now I'm staying about the Sydney region for a bit, living out of my pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day is dawning. It's raining again. Showers really. I'm grateful to be dry for now. I've spent a lot of time damp and will be again. My morning dilemma: wait for the shower to pass or pack and head off in the rain to find an open toilet? Not many public toilets are open overnight. Not good to wait too long. Whichever, I can't stay here too long. No one it's about in the rain, but they'll come. I can't be seen here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My travel by bicycle, I now look back on thinking it was so easy. Lots of space. Set up a tent! Dig a cat hole. Strip and wash under a bottle shower. Air dry. Sun bake. Hang out in camp. Stay clean. Carry lots of food and water. Always going somewhere, or doing something. Find food, water, campsite, a change of scenery. Never many people around.  When I started out it was terrifying. I had so many fears. It only got comfortable and easy with time and experience. I'm in the same place now. The fearful, terrifying place. Still working out how to deal with everyday issues. Where to sleep, toilet, get water, wash myself and my clothing, where to hang out at 6am when I can't stay in my bed. Where to wait till it gets dark enough to go to my bed. With time and experience I hope it'll get easy. But that's little consolation now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only last night I slept well. But I think it was just lack of sleep catching up with me. I want more sleep. I had found a place for a few nights. But rested uneasy, waking often. I like the spot, but I'm too conspicuous there. Soon someone will notice and I'll get rousted, maybe risk getting fined. I need a better spot. Another motivator is that if the rain continues today, my spot will be very muddy, if not under water. Definitely somewhere new tonight.  My wish for a quite spot has waned as I've become more accustomed to the city noise you don't notice inside: cars, trucks, dogs, people talking, planes taking off/landing. Noise I can handle. To sleep undisturbed is what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing is still on the list to solve. Cycling, my clothes didn't smell. I'd sweat and dry and my skin would get a layer of salt. Clothes got salty. I think the salt  stopped the bacteria that cause smell. Walking, I sweat, but stay damp, and don't salt up. Clothes start to smell. A quick rinse in a sink and put them back on wet is not enough to clean them. Wash and wear I call it. Even with the cool days and showers they dry eventually. Bit unpleasant putting them on, but it quickly passes. I need to get soap for the next wash. Need to wash me too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to wait out the current shower and use it to wash out my socks. The toilet, not yet urgent enough and perhaps not open either. I'll enjoy the time without having to move just a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once already I've downsized my pack. The easy discards. I thought I was being ruthless then. Further days have shown me my errors. I've still too much useless stuff. Each possession is mentally weighed. How essential it is now? Few things are. Extra clothing for cooler weather will be essential, but not now. It'll go. Weight and bulk are my pack enemies. Even the pack taunts me with its size and weight. It's day is coming. A heavy pack is awkward. Stands out. Hard on the body too. Full of useless stuff, I cannot fit more essential items. Or can't easily find what I want without emptying it. I've though about a shopping cart, but want the freedom of walking for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day ahead is large and empty. Sunrise is about 6, sunset about 8. What's open when and where. How to get there.

Mostly that is early morning, late in the afternoon, when it is cooler. Middle of the day, I visit a library to charge my phone. Then sit either outdoors or in a mall our shopping center, have my daily meal while people watching, day dreaming, or watching the wildlife. Sometimes I talk with people. Mostly it's the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've walked a few trails and suburbs that I've not been to before. Some nice walks about.  Many more to explore yet. Though, I want to carry less to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing a bit of community service. Walking past the same rubbish every day got to me. Someone should pick it up. I decided to be that someone. Starting carrying a bag and picking it up. I'm only filling one shopping bag a walk past, so will be cleaning some places for a while yet. Been reporting leaking taps/toilets to the council, water seeps to Sydney water, etc.  I don't get why the people who clean/resupply the toilets don't report leaks. Such a waste water!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still bedding down living. Finding water locations, open toilets, sleeping spots. Got very dehydrated a few times not drinking enough. Combination of few water fountains and fear of not finding a toilet when needed. (Also being in to populated areas with few bushes.) And just not thinking about drinking. Making an effort to drink more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still hunting the perfect sleeping spot. Had a couple of sleepless nights with bad choices. But it's been okay overall. The weather has been fine this past week. Any showers were light and after I was set up. Was a couple of heavy dew falls too. Sooner or latter will be heavier rain. I hope to have sleeping sorted before then. Or, might try for undercover. Wet gear is heavy, and I carry it outside my pack to keep the rest of my stuff dry. If it's only lightly damp, I leave it. But if it's dripping wet, I spread it out at lunch time to dry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pack weight has plummeted. Carrying everything everywhere really has me focused on having less. Down from 8 or 9kg to about 5.5kg now, including the pack. I changed to a smaller, lighter 45L pack, but it's not full, so I could go smaller yet. I'm not happy with the gear I am carrying, and am experimenting to drop it further. There are some trade-offs. I'm finding that some of the trade-offs are more mental than physical with comfort. And some of the physical comforts after a while you get used to having less. It's just the change that feels uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm changing my clothing. The long sleeve shirts and cycling shorts aren't as utilitarian as I'd like. Sweating in them walking, the shirts are large and difficult to wash. I'm trialling a layering system, so I can wash the thin, light, quick dry base layers more often, and the outer layers, hopefully less often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wipes were on sale and I purchased a packet to try.  Washing with wipes does feel better. But having a water shower still wins out. I had one this week. Washed my clothes under a tap at the same time. Midday in the sun, 34C, it all dried in an hour. I spread things on a park bench at first. Then draped first the shirt, then later the pants, on my head, both to cool me and to dry them faster. Next time will just wash and wear. It's faster that way. I don't want to pack away damp clothing as it will not dry in my pack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney and ?</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2018/05/2018-05-27-sydney-and/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-05-27T11:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2018-05-27T11:00:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2018-05-27:/posts/2018/05/2018-05-27-sydney-and/</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been longer than I'd planned since the last update.

&lt;p&gt;I originally wanted a bed base structure so that I could take the wheels off it and sleep a couple of centimeters off the ground. But as construction progressed, the weight increased, until that started to become a problem.  Back to ground sleeping without the platform. And the build is lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the trial goes well, I'll add eye holes to shade cloth to help tie down the load. A tarp will go over the top for weather protection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2019/image3.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of training and cart adjustments.  I changed how the mesh sits. It is now a single deeper compartment, rather than several segmented sections. I had tried newer handles, but discarded them before starting today. Still more work needed on the handles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of training and cart adjustments.  I changed how the mesh sits. It is now a single deeper compartment, rather than several segmented sections. I had tried newer handles, but discarded them before starting today. Still more work needed on the handles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google maps tells me the walk is 11.4 km on footpaths and fire trails. I had thought the trip was 8 km and hadn't considered the elevation change. I was worried about how slow and out of condition I'm feeling. Knowing it is actually 11.4 km makes me feel better. It's a good mix of hard, rough, sandy and hills. The outbound 5.7 km trip is very easy and fast. The return is another matter: it is up hill all the way except for the last kilometer. Much slower, with more rest stops.  I'm walking with test load of 30 kg of water, plus some tools in case of running repairs. No way pulling it up hill is ever going to be easy. The more I train now, the better I'll feel later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the first walk I have been very happy with the way the cart is working. The cart is light weight, handles well, rolls over obstacles easily, and the shade cloth has been excellent for holding gear in and keeping the center of gravity low. It has surprised me how rough and how uneven the ground I can travel on, and not tip the cart or tip gear out. All this is without a cover over the top, that I'll have later.  I originally wanted a fishing net, but now I think that shade cloth is much better. Small things just stay in the bottom and nothing falls through the holes. The depth of the net sling matters. On the first walk I had it quite high. This gave less load room and meant the handle ends hit the ground first when putting the cart down. This wasn't great for resting as the handles ended up in the dirt all the time. On any slope, stopping the cart moving needed wheel chocks as the handles slide on the ground very easily.  With the changes for today, the load sits on the ground when resting. Downside is that pulling the cart my heels sometimes hit the load even though the distance from the handles to the load start increased. Also, resting, the load sits in the dirt, which is okay when the resting spot is clean and dry, but is going to be a problem when wet and muddy.  I'll have to find a happy medium between the two.  I'm still thinking how to have light weight feet for the handle end that would keep the handles and load out of the dirt, and could let me sit on a low seat for resting too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still other changes to make to the cart. The basic design of the cart will stay the same. It works well pushing or pulling it. I will add a hip belt as that makes pulling it uphills easier, helps with resisting on the downhills. It feels like it saves energy, else I have to grip the handles hard enough to transmit the push/pull force. On the flats a hip belt gives my hands a rest. But the pull handles need to be far enough apart to not bang on my hips when walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brakes would be nice to add some drag for the downhills. I can walk in front and push back to slow or stop the cart, but walking behind and resisting is safer. On my first walk, my foot slipped on one of the downhills and while I didn't fall, I did realise that if I had, the cart would have run me over.  With changes for today, this is less likely, as the load hits the ground if the handles lower too far. But on a steep hill, the cart could still run me over before the load dragging stops the cart moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mudguards are an essential addition. Even on dry ground, sand, dirt and leaves stick to the tyres and fall off into the cart.  Mud and muddy water will also end up inside without mudguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something to sort urgently is footwear. I've had a lot of trouble with my feet over the past few years and worry that without the right footwear, the trip will be very short.  Modern footwear fashions are crazy:  heels with narrow and pointy toes.  I'm still wearing Vibram Five Fingers, which are excellent for being flat, having amble width, and not compressing the toes. But they are wearing out. Now in training time is the best time if I'm going to replace them with something else. But what?&lt;/p&gt;

, that continually needs repair. A pair of Merrell sandals that aren't great. I've modified to improve the fit. They are almost worn out, but I can't bring myself to throw out yet. And a pair of Vibram Five Finger (VFF) Trek Ascent that are worn, but not completely worn out: the pair I walked the

in. Starting a 2000km+ walk, none of those are going to last the distance. I need new shoes. But what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My feet are large and broad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2019/IMG_20190326_184332.jpg" &gt;
&lt;img src="https://meganleewebb.github.io/images/2019/IMG_20190326_184332.jpg"  /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Insoles on tracing of my feet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern shoes are weird. Really weird.
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-heeled_shoe"&gt;High heels&lt;/a&gt;
for everyone. Something that started with  calvary riders to keep help their feet on the stirrups when standing and shooting arrows, became a way to show you were rich enough to afford expensive heeled boots.  Then there are pointy toes.  Peasants had broad wide feet, so the aristocracy showed they were better by wearing pointy shoes.  Because the heel is raised, the sole is hard, so to make stepping easier, the toe area is raised to help the 'step off' part of walking.  And then, the edges of the shoe are raised as well.  I'm not sure if this is a "feature" or just the effect of injection moulding when attaching the top of the shoe to the sole. The edges get more material, to hold the top on, but the center gets less, so the foot bed becomes boat shaped.  The insole goes on top of the foot bed and attempts (unsuccessfully) to fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried the conventional shoes. I really wanted to be able to use them, just because of the ease of finding them. But on the practice walks, I just couldn't keep them on. My feet started to hurt. Worse, the changes wasn't just the feet; the knees, hips and back too.  Months of join pain, toes jammed up, and pushing the cart in heels wasn't want I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-heeled_shoe#Research_Studies_Conducted_on_the_Medical_Aspects_of_Wearing_Heels"&gt;There are problems with wearing heels&lt;/a&gt;
. The higher the heel, the worse the problems. Researchers use women's high heels for their studies as they are so extreme, but most shoes have heels. Unless you are wearing 'zero drop' shoes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted sandals, but haven't been able to find any that tick all the points I want: a flat foot bed, zero drop, no toe raise, no squashing the toes together and no toe post.  Such a sandal surely exists somewhere.  But for now, every time my feet hurt, my go to fix-it shoe is the VFF. I walked the 1000km Biblumun track in VFF's. They work for me. Why was I spending so much time on footwear when I could just wear them again. Decision done. Decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, where to get a new pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly the Trek Ascent model I have is no longer made.  I only had that model through a series of chance events, so this time I wanted to try on different models.  Luckily Sydney has
&lt;a href="https://barefootinc.com.au/"&gt;Barefoot Inc&lt;/a&gt;
.  It's
&lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vftbAiuQWRo"&gt;conveniently located&lt;/a&gt;
near Green Square Station, Alexandria.  Three times I went to look and try on different shoes before I decided.  Besides VFF, I was also looking at
&lt;a href="https://www.lemsshoes.com/"&gt;Lems&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.vivobarefoot.com/au"&gt;Vivobarefoot&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="https://xeroshoes.com/"&gt;Xero&lt;/a&gt;
shoes. The staff wear the shoes they are selling. So are able to give real feedback on the different models and their best use. They couldn't have been more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left with not one, but two pairs of new VVF.  It was a great deal that was too good to pass up. My feet are thanking me already.  The two pairs are old stock.  Models no longer made.  I'll definitely be back to Barefoot Inc in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interest point: For anyone thinking that you can't wear barefoot shoes on the road for long distances:

&lt;p&gt;Also hoping that adding an update will stop the spam bots.  Maybe they look and see no updates and think the blog is abandoned and so try to post comments. Been getting a lot lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tale of feet footwear sorrow follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly I wore a hole in the sole of my Vibram Five Fingers. I returned to
&lt;a href="https://barefootinc.com.au/"&gt;Barefoot Inc&lt;/a&gt;
for another pair, but found their retail store has closed. The building is being refurbished. They are still in business online until they find a new location, but I'd rather try on shoes than do the order/return cycle. Specially as Vibram Five Finger sizing is all over the place. It is not the same size between models, and they keep changing the models. All the Vibrams I have had have been different sizes, and apart from one occasion, different models.  As much as I and my feet like Vibrams, it has been an the increasing hassle finding them. I also really want sandals, specially with summer on the way. Time to try something new.  Something more easily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.unshoesusa.com/"&gt;Unshoes&lt;/a&gt;
looked good. The
&lt;a href="https://www.unshoesusa.com/products/pah-tempe"&gt;Pah Tempe 2.0&lt;/a&gt;
. I liked the strap placement so the toes can wave free, and the options for custom sole sizing. Ordered and they arrived quicker than expected. But I wasn't that happy with them.  The single strap adjustment is a compromise and the hold on the foot always feels loose. I'm still have them and continue to experiment with them, but the telling feature was I went back to wearing the Vibrams with the hole in the sole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In frustration I tried on a pair of work shoes in Kmart. Heavy with the steel cap, but could work. Decided to look at hiking shoes just to get some shoes and get walking more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ended up with a pair of
&lt;a href="https://www.keenfootwear.com/p/M-NEWPORT-H2.html"&gt;Keen Newport H2&lt;/a&gt;
. Pretty much a shoe with holes. I wavered on the sizing, and may have sized wrong with too large. Found out later there is a half size that might be a better fit.  Day one I walked 15 km in them and immediately had sore knees, feet and legs. Lesson: it takes adjustment after Vibrams, go easy.  That eventually settled down, and I was able to increase my walking distance. But now I'm working through blisters - heel, between the toes, and on the toe tips. I had preventative taped spots, but missed a couple - which did blister. Some might be because of callouses, but the heel blister is rubbing on the sandal. I'm not a fan of the moulded foot bed. Trying to decide if I sized wrong, or I just need to cut the moulding away in that spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So good to hear from you again. I had no idea just how complex it can be to find the right walking shoes. I do hope you find the right fit and feel soon and can get back to what you enjoy doing. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

The weather has been hotter and drying than normal. The fires have started earlier, are more numerous and burnt more than ever before. I'll stay in the city for the moment until the situation improves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm feeling more confident on my feet lately. I've been walking a minimium of 12km daily, with some days of 24km. Smoke and heat have limited the larger days. The amount of time it takes has also been a factor. The Keen sandals have been working well, but I miss the open toes of real sandals. So, I've started wearing a pair of Merrell Mojave Sport sandals a couple of days ago. My kind of sandal - no toe box, so the toes wiggle free. Early days yet on them. I've have also patched the Vibrams - so still wearing them sometimes, depending on where or what I'll be walking on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the shoes, I've been looking at how my body moves. I had thought I knew how to walk. Like, how hard is it? We all get it worked out by about 15 months. I started watching how I walk and reading about gait. I realised how little I knew. It's terribly complicated all the bits that work together for locomation. Where are the feet are pointing, which bit hits the ground first, how hard, are you upright, or hunched forward, pushing off with the rear foot, and on and on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when I started trying to monitor my own walking - what is that foot doing, I was reminded of this quote from Alan Watts, The Way of Zen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The centipede was happy, quite,&lt;/br&gt;
Until a toad in fun Said,&lt;/br&gt;
“Pray, which leg goes after which?”&lt;/br&gt;
This worked his mind to such a pitch,&lt;/br&gt;
He lay distracted in a ditch,&lt;/br&gt;
Considering how to run.”&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like the centipede. Watching how I walked or trying to change my gait, at times it feels like I can't walk. It is all too much to direct. I feel like a broken puppet and I can't walk unless I direct every action. At times I do end up stopped and need to forget about it for a while. With practice I'm getting better. Less broken feeling and more 'gliding along' times. It's a slow process. In the begining any change feel really weird, and require a huge amount of attention. This also triggers centipede freeze up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes are slow. It takes time paying attention to have the change stick. It is so easy to drift back to the old way. It also takes times for muscles and tendons to adapt to some of the changes. Things hurt, ache or feel tired really fast. I have to pace the effort. A little bit each day, slowly increasing the length of time. Then one day, I notice that the change has stuck and it doesn't feel weird anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm still working on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've restarted walking again. During 2020, I injured over and over, and at one point decided to abandon walking and return to cycling. But I'm a reluctant bicycle rider these days. Traffic volumes are up, perhaps more so now with everyone avoiding public transport.  But it's not the cars I'm afraid of. It's the drivers that terrify me. Too many can't resist the lure of the mobile phone screen, when they should be paying attention to driving. How much attention will they pay on country roads when there is less traffic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, no plans as yet for leaving. The pandemic situation is going to continue for some time. This is the new normal. So we all have to adjust to the changes. I'm staying in a friends house, and have settled into a daily routine I'm comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All up, I'm taking each day as it comes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Halloween</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2020/11/halloween/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-10T17:38:00+11:00</published><updated>2020-11-10T17:38:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2020-11-10:/posts/2020/11/halloween/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween"&gt;Halloween&lt;/a&gt; as a distinctly American tradition.

Over sold, and over consumed. I'm not a fan. I pull my old persons hat down, mumble about the Americanization of Australia, and try to ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also ponder the silence on the mountains of plastic ornaments consumed each year. Once they would have been hand made, or kept and treasured for years. But now, each celebration event has its own plastic merchandise that is manufactored, shipped, purchased, displayed, and then junked after the day is over. All in the space of a few days or weeks. Landfill or the ocean its out of sight, out of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually the first hint of Halloween is in the shops. Stocks of fake pumpkins, spider webs, witches, ghouls, bats, cats, and treats trickle in, and then explode into end of aisle displays as the final days count down. The plastic migrates via shopping carts and motor vehicles to the yards and footpaths of suburbia. As the day approachs the amount increases. Fake plastic cobwebs multiply, hanging in the shrubs, and spilling across the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the day, groups of children herd from house to house crying "trick or treat" over and over. I wonder if anyone chooses 'trick'? And what the trick is these days. They soon grab their allocation of sweets and scamper off to mob the next house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, the decorations slowly decay and are blown about the street by the wind. Actually, the responsible clean up their display. I only notice the few that don't. But they rest longer on my mind as I see them time and time again getting more tatty and weathered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of my feelings on Halloween, I had to stop and admire the effort put into this one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

Depending on mood, I gleefully or mindlessly scroll and click on it's suggestions. Sometimes it's fustrating for the unwanted options. I  curiously watch one video, didn't like it, but now it continually recommends more of the same. Days of my life have passed down rabbit holes. Discovering useful, fascinating, interesting, irrelevant knowledge and trivia. Occasionly it suggestions really hits a spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hit me with a hard truth. I think of myself as a traveller. But, glancing at the past posts archive, the last time I was really travelling was 2015. I can kid myself with some trips after that, but...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A write writes. A traveller travels. I am no longer a traveller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell myself that I have had good reason; medical issues (true), bushfires (true), COVID (mostly true). But, I've also settled into a routine. I've gotten comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounding like excuses, I do need to stay about Sydney for longer. Summer is coming - heat &amp;amp; bushfires, COVID continues, and I have some things plodding along requiring me to remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to do more travelling. I'm not certain when or if I'll leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I can do now, is to use my time better. Get organised. So everything is ready. In that spirit, late one afternoon, I decided to just go for an overnight. Gather my gear together, and go test it. Specially the new stuff that has never been used. With some reluctance, (a storm rolled in), I packed and was out the door into a light shower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very out of practice. A long list of items forgotten. Most hilarious: I had a mug, water, coffee powder, stove, fuel, but no lighter. After I'd returned, the backup fire starter was discovered at the bottom of my wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had a few more trips since then. Refining the gear list. Testing, discarding and replacing items. There is still more work to do yet.&lt;/p&gt;

Try not to kill anything. Easy enough. I mostly succeeded. Some over 40C days and snails did in a few seedlings. Acceptable losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I walked a lot. Checking out the sights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like the pictures. They are easy to relate to. Tags &lt;sup id="fnref:2"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; are harder to appreciate. They are in the same group as Pollock paintings&lt;sup id="fnref:3"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; some people love them, but to everyone else, it is just unintelligible scribble. I'd rate tags higher than Pollock paintings. Tags I can see mean something. There are letters there to be found like a Magic Eye&lt;sup id="fnref:4"&gt;&lt;a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; puzzle. It's a code, a language, it means something. Pollock paintings just look like scribble. Something a toddler did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is one is called "art" and put on display to sell for millions, while the other is called "graffiti" and costs millions to clean off or paint over?

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of information about walkability. A brief video about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4kmDxcfR48"&gt;what makes a city great&lt;/a&gt;. And more on urban planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.walkscore.com/apartments/search/AU-NSW/Sydney"&gt;Using this map&lt;/a&gt; I have been staying in a &lt;span style="color:Red"&gt;Red Zone&lt;/span&gt;. Not walkable. My holiday was in a &lt;span style="color:Lime"&gt;Green Zone&lt;/span&gt;. Very walkable. The difference was eye opening. I'd become habituated to blandness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently, an hour fast walk is about 6km. Most of that is along a busy road. Off that I'm passing cookie cutter style housing. The type were every front yard is manicured to the peer accepted level. There are a couple of cafes along the way near a train station, but otherwise shops are clustered inside a shopping center. Blank boxes, designed to trap you inside, where the layout is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gruen_transfer"&gt;confusing and disorentating&lt;/a&gt;. Everything planned to encourage you to &lt;a href="https://www.choice.com.au/shopping/everyday-shopping/shopping-centres/articles/shopping-centre-design"&gt;buy more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not very interesting walking about the suburbs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All great and wonderful. Took it for a few short walks while I was working out the bugs. Then set off on a 20km shakedown trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few days later I started developing sore knees. I'm not sure why. The walk was easy. Nothing hard, no big hills. No rush. I took all day for 20km. So lots of resting, reading, and watching the world go by. 20km wasn't an unusual distance. My daily morning constitutional was 12km at a brisk pace. Then the days activities were on top of that. Usually a lot more walking, but some cycle rides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A physio visit later and the diagnosis was "tendinitis". Treatment: Nothing surprising. Cut the activity levels right down. Cycling is preferable as it's low impact. Only about two or three months to recover. 😦&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I am, recovering, &lt;span style="font-weight:900"&gt;again&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The "basket" on the front is a "Garden City Plastic Grow Plant Pot - 410mm Black 28L $6.50 " from Bunnings. It won out over the "Tactix 25L Black Collapsible Crate $9.98 " by the sleek aerodynamic shape,  lighter weight, increased volume and being slightly cheaper.  Time will tell if it is up to the rigours of life as a basket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for now, I love the space it provides. The old K-Mart wire basket was miserly with space. A bicycle lock and  my backpack with shopping was always a tight squeeze. I needed to give it a bit of encouragement to fit and even then, I didn't always succeed. This new basket it voluminous. The shopping and the bicycle lock vanish inside with ample room for more goods.  A good sized basket is essential in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Sydney COVID lockdown!</title><link href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2021/09/sydney-covid-lockdow/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-09-01T06:11:00+10:00</published><updated>2021-09-01T06:11:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Megan Lee Webb</name></author><id>tag:meganleewebb.github.io,2021-09-01:/posts/2021/09/sydney-covid-lockdow/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've never had my own pet before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing up there was the household animals - cats, dogs, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#Terminology"&gt;chooks&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Growing up there was the household animals - cats, dogs, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#Terminology"&gt;chooks&lt;/a&gt;. And a group of brief visitors vaguely remembered like  the freshwater turtles that only lasted a night, before they baffling escaped?   Or not remembered at all:  A cow and some goats. I have idea of their fates. In a family story recounted often, the goats only lasted until they ate the sheets off the washing line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cats came and went as they wanted. Sometimes, looking healthy, other times beat up. They got fed when there where about. Their appearances grew more and more infrequent, until one day it was noticed they hadn't returned for a long time and clearly they were never coming back.  Did they move to a better place, or did they meet an untimely end. We never knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dogs were more mum and dads pets. The inside dog was mums. Spoilt rotten. Outside dogs - dads. We kids were involved, but incidentally so - taking food out at times, or cleaning up after them. The chooks where more of our responsibility. Our, as in "all the kids" - a group commitment. Like all groups, it was an uneven commitment. Some doing more of work to avoid punishment. Collect the eggs, check the food and water, close the chook house door at night. The chooks weren't thought of as pets. They were the egg producers, and looking after them was a job that had to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always wanted pigeons, but our drinking water was collected of the house roof into a rain water tank. Having pigeons, who would be sitting and pooping on the roof was never going to be allowed to happen.  I thought to get pigeons now, but with COVID lockdown that option is blocked. None of the Gumtree pigeon sales are close. But there we Quail about! So I've joined the group of people getting pets while in lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was to have been gone from Sydney, but... COVID. I figured the lockdown is going to go for months, so long enough to have some pets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meet Omelet and Dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The names are not suggesting anything. They just happened to spring to mind when I was carrying them back. Omelet does lay an egg a day. Four or five quail eggs equals one chicken egg, so any omelets are going be small, or also infrequent. Dinner, he keeps Omelet company. I wanted more, but the seller only had the pair left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have two homes. Nights are spent inside. Days outside in their larger holiday home. It's not suitable for overnight stays. Not build to a high enough predator proof rating. Cats, dogs, foxes, snakes, rats. Too many critters that would love an overnight snack. This one came past early one morning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder if it was the scent of quail that attracted it. I've never seen one in the yard before. Only fleeting glances when bush walking.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry></feed>
