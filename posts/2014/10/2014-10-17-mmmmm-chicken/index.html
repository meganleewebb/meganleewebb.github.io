<p>Well, it looks like chicken. It's small; not much bigger than a quail. Organic? No way. With all the farms here; pesticides and herbicides abound. Free range? Most definitely.</p>
<p>Fresh. No broken bones. It was in good shape, so I plucked and gutted it.  A wash to get the blood out, and done.</p>
<p>Boiled, with veggies, lentils, fresh peas,  pasta and a touch of curry.</p>
<p>My meat cooking is improving. This was very tender. Almost falling of the bone. Then it was a young bird, and I didn't cook it long.</p>
<p>It gave a slight flavor to the pot, or maybe I imagined that. Not much meat. The breasts had the most, with the legs next. Though not even a mouthful all up. Lots of sucking on bones really.</p>
<p>Was this worth it?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Washing the carcass, knife and hands used 1.5 litres of water. The clean up of the cooking gear used more water than normal to get the oil/fat off.</p>
<p>Two plastic bags to keep it till I cooked it. Both have blood on them, so are now rubbish.</p>
<p>If it was a quail, it would have provided at most 200 calories. Most estimates are less and work on about 100 grams of meat after removing bones. I think I had less than that.</p>
<p>A quarter cup of sultanas is 145 calories.</p>
<p>A tablespoon olive oil is 119 calories.</p>
<p>A tablespoon of peanut butter is around 100 calories (depends on brand, and how heaped the spoon:-)</p>
<p>A medium apple is about 100 calories.</p>
<p>So it's not providing major calories. Not major anything really as its to small to contribute much.</p>
<p>Doing not a lot, the average person needs about 2000 calories a day.  Ten birds and it would make their basal calorie requirements. Exercise, and that increases. I pedal between four to six hours a day. I'd need a whole flock.</p>
<p>Since it was showering here, I'd think no spraying recently, lowering the birds recent pesticide/herbicide intake. If there was a lot of spraying happening, it could have high levels if it was feeding in the sprayed areas. Impossible to know how much your eating.</p>
<p>All up, for the time, effort, water and calories, there are better choices to be had.</p>
