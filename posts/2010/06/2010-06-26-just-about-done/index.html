                <p>Just about finished building.  Did some riding in the rain (again). Slash guards worked well. Will keep them on. Much cleaner feet at the end of the day. Cleaner bike also.</p>

<p>Decided not to use cloth around the Go-Getters. That would involve a lot of sewing - edges and eyelet holes. Although I've a 5000m of thread. I don't want to wait about here to get all that done. In a moment of thinking - bought a small tarp. Cost less than $4. Promptly doubled its value by putting a few more eyelets around the edge. Its big enough to go over the rack, down the sides, and up a short way on the outside.  There is also a bit to cover the ends. I'm thinking to run a string through the eyelets and use some ocky straps across the top to hold it all together.  I haven't tried it with the bags yet (tomorrow), but it looks like it will do the job of keeping mud of them. I can also use it as a rain shelter when not riding. When I ordered the frame and got the Go-Getters, I did think about using a tarp then - kind of like the Xtracycle Freeloader bags. Wasn't sure, and the Go-Getters were a great price, and they are huge!!.  I like being able to open the top and dump Stuff in. Shut the lid and its  water proof. The Go-Getters are well thought out - with buckles, and bits of velcro in the right places to pin extra strap up off the road.</p>
<p>Also decided not to cover the chain any further. If I put a disk on the chain ring, there will only be a couple of inches of chain free at the rear cog.</p>

<p>Used a piece of water pipe found on the side of the road to stop the fork swinging right around and bashing the light. Its cut so that the wheel can be almost at right angles - something that shouldn't happen riding. The spring under neath keeps the wheel straight when the bike is on the center stand. Still having problems with that spring - the extra long hoses push the wheel slightly to the right - no much, but precludes hands off riding. Changing the location of the hoses helps - but will wait until I can shorten them before playing with the spring again.</p>

<p>Found a Red Bull can on the side of the road - used that to make some sleeves around the seal on the pedal. Red Bull cans are very thin. The join is is made like this:</p>
<pre>
  _________  
  \  
   \  \ 
 ______\ 
</pre>

<p>When squashed flat - its secure against popping open. Cause to take the pedals off - it has to be pulled off. Tins are common along the road side. Use scissors to cut.</p>

<p>The chain guard does a great job of keeping mud off the chain. All this would have ended up a grinding past on the chain.</p>

<p>Hi Meg. I found your blog as I was searching ways to tune up my Yuba Mundo for a long bike tour. My destination is central asia "stans". I've only one and half months to repare  myself and the bike before I go. I don't have fancy components but your blog still has a lot of valuable information.</p>
<p>For example your experience with Go-Getters was that they are too big. Good to know that since I was allmost going to buy them. Now I'll buy Ortlieb packs that are half the size. I'll also buy heavy duty rims.</p>
<p>I set up my own blog, it's called endless-upphill.blogspot.com</p>
<p>Feel free to check it out.</p>
<p>With respect, KAI</p>
