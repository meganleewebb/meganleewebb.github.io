<p>I've been meaning to comment on  using the Go-Getters for touring for a while now. Time to do it. They are huge! But, i think that they are not the best for touring.  This is my experience so far:</p>
<p>They are not 100% water and dust proof. The lid folds over the bag opening. I've not been able to get it to a state that i'm happy with in dusty conditions, or that i'd trust it in driving rain. In rain i'm having important stuff in plastic bags. This is annoying.</p>
<p>Dust sticks in the weave of the fabric.</p>
<p>I think they might be mean't to be used with running boards and side boards. I'm not using either, and have found that the braze- on points, with button bolts in them are wearing the bags out. See the holes in the bottom of one bag in the pictures.</p>
<p>The clips are not easy to operate, if your taking the bags on and off daily. I have ended up using two hold points on each bag-the inside two. The outside two are used to attach the shoulder strap. The shoulder strap makes picking up loaded bags easier.</p>
<p>I find that i cannot stuff goods into them in the same way as using roll top bags. If i stuff them too hard, the lid has a larger gap which has me worried for water and dust.</p>
<p>My bags sit on the wide loader, which is lower than the wheel axle. This is good for center of gravity, but the down side is that i've scrapped the bags on rocks, stumps, and road kill. They now have tiny holes.</p>
<p>The bags are weighty on their own. This is more in comparison to roll top bags. The fabric is thick and should last ages.</p>
<p>Both shoulder straps broke the adjustment bit of plastic. Since this is one attachment point, both are now tied onto the bags.</p>
<p>I'll be getting some roll top plastic bags. Ortlieb make some. I'm considering removing the wide loaders, and attaching some core flute on the sides of the rack. The two bags will them be hung in a cloth sling on the side. This will place them above the axle.</p>
<p>I'll have to visit a larger town when mobile again to get the cloth, well probably canvas. I'll have a photo then. It may be easier to understand then.</p>

<p>I'm waiting eagerly to see what kind of inventive suspension systems you will make.</p>

<p>It'll be similar to the Xtracycle cargo bag- the Freeloader but made from canvas..</p>
<p>You'll not see that for several weeks yet. I'm estimating 3 weeks until my wheels are back. Then another week to get to a large town and buy stuff.I'm currently a long way from anywhere.</p>
