                <p>Been a long time since the last post. In the way of life, a lot has happened, but not much really. The <a href="https://meganleewebb.github.io/posts/2022/01/new-plan-time/">New Plan Time</a> didn't happen. It started well, but, then I injured my back. ☹️</p>
<p>There's a joke that goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day the different parts of the body were having an argument to see which should be in charge.</p>
<p>The brain said "I do all the thinking so I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>The eyes said "I see everything and let the rest of you know where we are, so I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>"I should be in charge," said the heart, "I circulate oxygen and nutrients all over."</p>
<p>The hands said "Without me we wouldn't be able to pick anything up or move anything. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>The stomach said "I turn the food we eat into energy for the rest of you. Without me, we'd starve. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>The legs said "Without me we wouldn't be able to move anywhere. So I'm the most important and I should be in charge."</p>
<p>"I should be in charge," said the anus, "I am responsible for waste removal."</p>
<p>All of the other body parts laughed at the anus and insulted him. So he shut down. Within a few days, the brain had a terrible headache, the hands were all shaky, the stomach was bloated, the legs got wobbly, the eyes got watery, and the heart pumped toxic blood. They all decided that the anus should be the boss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the spine was watching with amusement.</p>
<p>Anyone with a back injury knows, when it's bad, everything is painful. Standing, sitting, lying, moving the arms, even waste removal hurts.</p>
<p>When the pain lessened, a new plan was hatched. I didn't think I'd be able to move my bike and gear about without help. Assistance was needed. I decided to dip my toe into ebikes with a "cheap" upgrade kit. This ended up not being the cheap option it first appeared. I could have bought a new ebike for less, as various components on my bike needed upgrading or changing. Still, I'm happy with the learning experience and I like the frankenstein look of my bike.</p>
<p>Now, I need some way to carry my gear, and power the ebike.</p>
