<p>Well, 5 hours later, I'm back where I started in Cardwell.</p>
<p>The day before rode over a hill to see two cyclists on the road! Wow.. Need to catch them. And I did for a bit. But I think they didn't like my music, and soon pulled away. We met up again and spent the night at a caravan park in Cardwell. They are riding for
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/breakthecycle2015?fref=ts">Break the cycle campaign 2015</a>
.  Great stuff. We talked long into the night. Was really glad that we'd chanced to meet up.</p>
<p>We rode out next morning, but my destination was Long Pocket. Will and Safi were off to Ingham.  Unfortunately the "road" to Long Pocket closed in 1881, and is now a very rocky walking track. Never letting that stop me, I spent an hour pushing up hill before admitting defeat having covered less than 1km. Running out of water also, and pretty stuffed, battered and brused, I returned to Cardwell for the night.</p>
<p>The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldQrapQ4d0Y">lyrics from the Toby Keith song</a>
were running in my head;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'Now my body says, "You can't do this boy"
But my pride says, "Oh, yes you can
I ain't as good as I once was
Thats just the cold hard truth'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe it wasn't a wise decision to have tried that. Now I'm bruised and sore. And will have to take it easy for a while to recover.  I've also reconsidered my plan to head to Charters Towers by a similar route, that would have involved much much more climbing.</p>
