                <p>When seeing the dunny in the previous post, I couldn't help but remember this
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_poet">bush poem</a>
:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Poor Old Grandad!</strong></p>
<p>Poor old Granddad's passed away, cut off in his prime,<br>
He never had a day off crook - gone before his time,<br>
We found him in the dunny, collapsed there on the seat,<br>
A startled look upon his face, his trousers around his feet,<br>
The doctor said his heart was good - fit as any trout,<br>
The Constable he had his say, 'foul play' was not ruled out.<br>
There were theories at the inquest of snakebite without trace,<br>
Of redbacks quietly creeping and death from outer space,<br>
No-one had a clue at all - the judge was in some doubt,<br>
When Dad was called to have his say as to how it came about,<br>
'I reckon I can clear it up,' said Dad with trembling breath,<br>
'You see it's quite a story - but it could explain his death.'<br>
'This here exploration mob had been looking at our soil,<br>
And they reckoned that our farm was just the place for oil,<br>
So they came and put a bore down and said they'd make some trials,<br>
They drilled a hole as deep as hell, they said about three miles.<br>
Well, they never found a trace of oil and off they went, post haste,<br>
And I couldn't see a hole like that go to flamin' waste,<br>
So I moved the dunny over it - real smart move I thought,<br>
I'd never have to dig again - I'd never be 'caught short'.<br>
The day I moved the dunny, it looked a proper sight,<br>
But I didn't dream poor Granddad would pass away that night,<br>
Now I reckon what has happened - poor Granddad didn't know,<br>
The dunny was re-located when that night he had to go.<br>
And you'll probably be wondering how poor Granddad did his dash--<br>
Well, he always used to hold his breath<br>
Until he heard the splash!!<br></p>
