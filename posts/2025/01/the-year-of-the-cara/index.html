                <p>This year the caravan will finish! Well, finished enough to be in use. I'm not sure it will ever really be finished. Already I have a list of fixes, changes and improvements. But not now. The focus is on getting it done. Changes can happen later.</p>
<p>December was looking promising. I had lined up time with my welder friend to get some chassis fixes done. The brake caliper mount. Strength the draw bar attachment. Make the disk brake handle mounting seen in the previous post. I also lined up another friend to help with the electrical wiring. The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I caught COVID. There are no quarantine rules anymore, but I wasn't going to share the infection.</p>
<p>I did end up getting the welding done. And over the Christmas - New Year time, got the disk brakes mounted. The cabin got another coat of paint on the outside also. I've still more to finish and look forward to the Men's Shed reopening.</p>
<p>The delay for the electrics turned into a good thing. It was going to be two ebike batteries: one on the ebike, one in the caravan. Charge the one in the caravan, swap with the ebike when required. But the caravan battery needs to provide power while it is charging. The BMS in the battery I have doesn't allow that. If it is charging, discharge stops. A work around was to charge it via the discharge port, but I wasn't keen on that solution. I thought to have a small 12v battery for caravan supply, and charge that from the ebike battery or solar. Eventually I decided to have the caravan just use a 12v battery and skip the second ebike battery. I'll charge the ebike battery when I'm stopped.</p>
<p>Well, that's the plan.</p>
