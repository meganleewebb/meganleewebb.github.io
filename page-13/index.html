<p>Wet and cool is how things are now. Decided to escape the 36C temps out west and get closer to the coast. Funny how now a bit of that sun would be nice to dry everything out.</p>

<p>Last day doing things in Stonehenge. Was helping cut the law on the ride on. Never used one before. I managed to:</p>
<p>Find the bottomless pit (in fairness it wasn't marked, and was hidden in the knee high grass)</p>
<p>Cut the water pipe (plastic also hidden)</p>
<p>Am now in Blackall. Was a long hot ride from Stonehenge to Isisford. Rolled in on 7pm after leaving at 4am. There was stops during the hot part of the day, and lots of rest stops after that. Slept several times.</p>
<p>Isisford the river was over the bridge. Walked that pushing the bike. Lots of mossies and sandflies about right now.</p>
<p>Still having lots of hassles with bags. My blue waterproof bags are that, but getting them on the bike hasn't been as successful as i'd thought it would be. Thinking now that panniers, the tried and tested touring gear carriers are the go. My gear at the moment is held on with lots of straps and ocky straps. Looks big and messy, and is a pain to get on and off the bike and to find anything. Am sitting the blue bags in the yellow Go Getters. It the blue bags are upright, they tend to fall outwards. Lie them down and opening them without unpacking is hard. Tried putting different amounts of gear in them, and in the Go Getters. Haven't found a combination that works for me.</p>
<p>The fatter tires are way better. They provide some suspension, and track better on the dirt roads.</p>

<p>It's been raining a fair bit out here. Most unusual for September. The weir is flowing.</p>
<p>I using the mop each day. Cleaning the pub. My favourite kitchen appliance is the dishwasher! Load, press the button. 2 hours latter unpack hot dry everything! If i can fit it in, it's going to washed by the machine. Still there are lots that don't fit. So hot water, soap, rubber gloves and scrub.</p>
<p>Oh for my wheels...</p>

<p>I've been meaning to comment on  using the Go-Getters for touring for a while now. Time to do it. They are huge! But, i think that they are not the best for touring.  This is my experience so far:</p>
<p>They are not 100% water and dust proof. The lid folds over the bag opening. I've not been able to get it to a state that i'm happy with in dusty conditions, or that i'd trust it in driving rain. In rain i'm having important stuff in plastic bags. This is annoying.</p>
<p>Dust sticks in the weave of the fabric.</p>
<p>I think they might be mean't to be used with running boards and side boards. I'm not using either, and have found that the braze- on points, with button bolts in them are wearing the bags out. See the holes in the bottom of one bag in the pictures.</p>
<p>The clips are not easy to operate, if your taking the bags on and off daily. I have ended up using two hold points on each bag-the inside two. The outside two are used to attach the shoulder strap. The shoulder strap makes picking up loaded bags easier.</p>
<p>I find that i cannot stuff goods into them in the same way as using roll top bags. If i stuff them too hard, the lid has a larger gap which has me worried for water and dust.</p>
<p>My bags sit on the wide loader, which is lower than the wheel axle. This is good for center of gravity, but the down side is that i've scrapped the bags on rocks, stumps, and road kill. They now have tiny holes.</p>
<p>The bags are weighty on their own. This is more in comparison to roll top bags. The fabric is thick and should last ages.</p>
<p>Both shoulder straps broke the adjustment bit of plastic. Since this is one attachment point, both are now tied onto the bags.</p>
<p>I'll be getting some roll top plastic bags. Ortlieb make some. I'm considering removing the wide loaders, and attaching some core flute on the sides of the rack. The two bags will them be hung in a cloth sling on the side. This will place them above the axle.</p>
<p>I'll have to visit a larger town when mobile again to get the cloth, well probably canvas. I'll have a photo then. It may be easier to understand then.</p>

<p>I'm waiting eagerly to see what kind of inventive suspension systems you will make.</p>

<p>It'll be similar to the Xtracycle cargo bag- the Freeloader but made from canvas..</p>
<p>You'll not see that for several weeks yet. I'm estimating 3 weeks until my wheels are back. Then another week to get to a large town and buy stuff.I'm currently a long way from anywhere.</p>

                <p>More new jobs. Got to drive a bobcat for two days. Just like a playstation one guy said. Well i've never had a playstation, but the bobact was fun. Very intuitive controls; two joy sticks. Actually, its really called a front skid loader, but everyone knows the one brand: Bobcat.</p>
<p>Today was a trip to Windorah. I became a liquid waste management expert.</p>
<p>Okay, i drove a truck. Known as the "poop truck".</p>
<p>Yeap, i pumped shit. Tanks in the ground fill up, someone (me today) drives up in a truck with a large tank, and a pump.  Put hose from pump into the tank, and pump until truck tank is full. Drive to a remote dump point and open value to empty truck tank. Avoid all contact with liquids, and stay upwind. Repeat until ground tank is empty.</p>
<p>Its a smelly job, but someone has to do it.</p>
